## What's this

A fork of general purpose yuta0801/scrapbox-reader.
It retrieves content data via Scrapbox's API and deliver it statically.

Advantage:

- We can customize its view as wwe want. (Of course we need programming)
- It compatible with machine translation and web archiving.

Disadvantage:

- We can not edit contents directly.

I've added some features that is specific to my Scrapbox only.

## How to use

It is recommended to fork from the original yuta0801/scrapbox-reader, because I hard-coded some value for my project.

I use Vercel to deploy it. It is very easy.

## Development

`$ npm run dev`

It starts server on 0.0.0.0:3000.
