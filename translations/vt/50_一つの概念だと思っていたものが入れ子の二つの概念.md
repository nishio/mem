- We were discussing a concept referred to as A.
- However, it wasn't being communicated effectively.
- Upon deeper investigation, it was discovered that there are actually two concepts referred to as A.
    - From here on, we will distinguish them as A1 and A2.
- These two concepts have an [[inclusion relationship]] within the [[event space]].
    - In other words:
        - If it is A1, then it is A2.
        - Even if it is A2, it is not necessarily A1.
- When we do not pay attention to the phenomenon of "being A2 but not A1," or if it is very rare, A1 and A2 appear to be the same.
    - As a result, both are referred to by the single term A.
    - This results in the boundary of the concept A being blurred, as shown in the diagram on the lower left.
    - Humans sometimes manipulate symbols without realizing the boundaries of concepts are blurred.
        - Unless trained to clarify boundaries, this is often overlooked.
