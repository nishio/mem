Phenomenon Observed in the [[Difference Between Vice and Evil]]
- The term X referred to two nested concepts.
- Consequently, those observing the narrow X think "A is not X," while those observing the broad X think "A is X."

- Related to this: [[Question of Relationships]]
    - Highly abstract, though.
    - > Are X and Y the same or different?
    - > Appears neutral but is a [[False Dichotomy]]
    - > Excludes possibilities of [[Inclusion Relationships]] or [[Overlap]]
        - Extracted [[Same or Different? Is a False Dichotomy]] ([[Line Links Are Opportunities for Extraction]])
- [[What Was Thought to Be One Concept Is Two Nested Concepts]]
    - This is more specific.
    - Close but not identical to this case.
        - This is an individual's case.

        - This might be essential.
        - Perhaps perceiving meaning as a set is fundamentally flawed.
            - People recognize word meanings through representative examples in their minds and their similarity.
            - A set can be formed by setting an appropriate threshold for this similarity, but the threshold isn't clearly recognized.
            - Thus, it becomes a "fuzzy boundary set" like the diagram above.
            - The phenomenon of "the concept of X being a nested set" is simply a difference in thresholds.
            - Only by comparing meanings with suitable individuals can the difference in thresholds be visualized.

                - [[Meaning Is Not a Set]]
                - Meaning is not a set with clear boundaries, but a [[Fuzzy Boundary]] with a [[Fuzzy Circle]]
                - Extending this is the "non-numerical character of meaning" explained in [[Study Group on Experiential Process and Meaning Creation #61fb7718aff09e00004a7667]]
        - [[Meaning Is a Vector]], but that alone is just a point.
            - The operation of "A is X" becomes a complete match only.
            - Instead, it involves several representative vectors in the mind and their similarity.
            - Setting a threshold for this similarity forms a set.
                - (2023-02-04) However, humans do not have a clear threshold and determine boundaries vaguely.
            - Representative vectors compete for space, forming boundaries like a [[Self-Organizing Map]]
                - Not even determining similarity.
        - Ah, meaning is not clearly defined as a set but as a group connected by similarity, which is Wittgenstein's [[Family Resemblance]]!
            - > Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his book 'Philosophical Investigations,' discusses the term "game" (German: Spiel), pointing out that there is no common intension (meaning) that characterizes all the extensions (objects) called "games." Instead, the whole is loosely connected by partially common features like "having a winner" or "being entertaining," which he named family resemblance. This idea, along with [[Prototype Theory]], serves as an antithesis to the classical category view that attempts to define word meanings by necessary and sufficient conditions.

            - > The categories humans actually possess are not classical categories defined by necessary and sufficient conditions but are characterized by typical examples and their similarity... For instance, the word "bird" typically evokes small flying animals like crows or sparrows, while ostriches or penguins fall outside typical examples.
