[[What You Feel When Reading a Book]]
The way development unfolds after thinking, "Isn't that wrong?"
- [[Sense of Discomfort]]

- C1
    - "Huh? But this aligns well with this and that."
    - "Was I wrong in my previous assumptions?"
    - Realize your own [[Assumptions]]
    - An opportunity to break free from [[Erroneous Learning]]

- C2
    - "It still contradicts this and that."
    - "Isn't there something wrong with the book's description?"
    - Realize the errors in the book's description
    - This pattern is a big loss as it yields nothing despite the costs

- C3
    - Partially support and partially oppose
    - Embrace the structure of the conflict itself
    - [[6 and 9]]
    - Realize that what seemed to be [[Conflict]] is actually just a [[Difference in Perspective]]
    - [[Multiple Perspectives Thinking]]
    - The "Ha" of [[Shuhari]]
    - [[Integrative Thinking]]
    - [[Dialectics]]
    - There is progress in the perspective from which you observe things, making it very beneficial but high-cost
