    - A FLAT society is homogeneous and singular.
        - This can be perceived as a constant function.
    - A STEP society is divided into parts (division).
        - The term "step" comes from the concept of a [[ステップ関数]] (step function).
    - The NAMERAKA Society, proposed by Ken Suzuki, is characterized by a smooth boundary without division.
        - Although not shown in the slide, it is depicted as a [[シグモイド関数]] (sigmoid function) in his book.
    - We must not create a homogeneous world to eliminate division.
        - We need to smooth the boundaries.
