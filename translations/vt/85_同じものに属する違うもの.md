When a subject has a broad scope, the opinions that "they are different" based on "not being exactly identical," and "they are the same" based on "belonging to the same subject" can coexist.
- This is one of the phenomena that occur when opinions of "same" and "different" conflict.
- For example, the debate "Am I the same person today as I was yesterday, or am I different?"
- This conflict can be resolved through this method.

Reference: The debate on the [[Ship of Theseus]], where a ship whose parts are gradually replaced until none of the original parts remain is questioned whether it remains the same ship.
