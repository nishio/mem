A discussion on how observing the same phenomenon can lead some to believe there is [[effectiveness]] while others believe there is none.
- A: If you invest enough cost, the end result is the same, so there is no [[effect]].
- B: When compared at a certain cost, there is improvement, so there is an effect.
- C: The cost required to achieve a certain performance is reduced, so there is an effect.

Whether the cost in the scenario of "investing enough cost" feels large or small is influenced by one's [[cost perception]].
