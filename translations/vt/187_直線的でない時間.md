A: [[Linear Time Axis]]
- We tend to implicitly assume this
- The objective time marked by clocks is this
B: Non-Linear Time
- [[Subjective Time]]
    - Experienced individually
    - Reliving the same past multiple times
- Statements like "subjective time is non-linear" are abstract and hard to convey
- Consider more concrete examples
- For instance, a Scrapbox page written in the past resurfaces for some reason, and you open and read it
    - At this moment, from the page's perspective, it's a continuation of the time from when it was "written" and "closed"
        - Notes on perspective shift
            - Here, the subject and object switch between "me" and "the page I wrote," viewing myself as the object from the page's perspective
                - [[Indivisibility of Action and Actor]] / [[Subject-Object Exchange]]
            - From the page's perspective, the timeline continues, and I, as the object, have a slightly new experience, altering my internal state
- This page itself is an example
    - I happened to revisit "[[The Concept of Time in Gendlin's Philosophy]]" on 2024-08-30
    - This was shared with [[blu3mo]] on 2023-10-12
        - I was interested in [[Eugene Gendlin]] as a philosopher practicing verbalization, and while reading, I came across a discussion on time
        - Although I wasn't particularly interested in time, I remembered that blu3mo was intrigued by non-linear time, so I extracted the relevant part
    - This "happened to revisit" is B1
    - At this moment, the self who finished writing last time and the self reading now are different
        - Therefore, there is a difference (B2)
    - From this difference, something new emerges (B3)
        - It's dialectical, but it doesn't need to be in a strong sense
            - [[Focus on Differences in Similarities]]
                - The page as a subject observes two slightly different people
            - When two related but different things meet, a new [[Aspect of Experience]] is formed
        - Last time, I only introduced the concept of time in Gendlin's philosophy
        - I didn't have much reflection on time, so it ended halfway
        - This is a state of "having a [[Gap to Fill]]"
        - In semiconductor terms, it's like a [[Hole]]
            - [[Electrons and Holes]]
    - Proceeding from this newly created state (B4)
        - Since I've been describing from the page's perspective, the synthesis of two points feels disconnected from my previous self
        - From the human perspective as the subject, they are connected

I am writing this out and thinking half outside my brain, making the thought process partially observable
- For those who haven't written it down, "suddenly remembering something from the past" becomes a [[Intersection of Past and Present]]

[[Past Self]] and [[Joint Attention]]
