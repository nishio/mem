Whether you are above or below the level of fulfillment, the meaning of the exact same arrow changes entirely.

- However, the level of fulfillment is subjective and varies from person to person, making it difficult for others to guess.
    - To make matters worse, some people perceive "not being fulfilled" as "shame" and try to hide it, making it even more challenging.

For those above the line, the arrow represents something that is a "plus if present, but not necessary."

- For those below the line, the same arrow becomes "something necessary to be fulfilled."
