- 1: We perceive X and Y as being in opposition.
- 2: However, both X and Y are ambiguous concepts with expansiveness and overlap.
- 3: In linguistic symbols, the opposition between X and Y remains unchanged, but when we observe the expansion of their meanings, what was once called Y is now referred to as X.

Concrete Examples:
[[Stable Trade Routes Emerge]]

[[False Dichotomy]]
