- When we say "If you increase X, Y will also increase," we are implicitly considering a binary choice of "increase/not increase."
- However, when considering the amount of increase, even if "If you increase X, Y will also increase" is true, there are cases where the increase is not as much as expected.
- If the increase is non-zero, it is considered "increased."
- "Suppose you add a cup of water to a lake. It is incorrect to say the water level does not rise, and foolish to say it rises significantly." [[Analogy of the Lake and the Cup]]
- [[False Dichotomy]]
- [[Resolution Levels]]
