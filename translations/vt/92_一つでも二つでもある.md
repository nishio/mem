The dialectical approach resolves the conflict between the idea of "two opposing entities" and "the existence of one entity" by considering that the [[extension]] of one entity can manifest as two. 

[[Spinoza]] synthesized the notion of "the opposition between mind and matter" with the idea of "the singular existence of God" by proposing that both matter and mind are [[extensions of God]].

On 2024-08-26, it was noted that [[Two Aspects of One Entity]] expressed a similar idea, connected through Spinoza's concept of "extensions of God":
- > One entity possesses multiple aspects.
- > Each aspect is "different" rather than "the [[same]] thing," yet they are "different aspects of the [[same entity]]."
- > Observing "different aspects of the same entity" evokes the concept of [[extensions of God]].
