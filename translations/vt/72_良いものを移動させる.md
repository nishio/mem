> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1462998113967218688): Even if it is beneficial to terminate certain processes within a group, it can be challenging. In such cases, create a new group and transfer the processes you wish to sustain there. This mechanism has been repeatedly used in various applications.

Examples:
- Create a new chat room when there is an unpleasant person in the current one, and move the key people there, allowing the old room to wither.
- Spin off or sell a successful department of a company to prevent the struggling department from using the profits generated by the successful one. The successful department thrives without the burden of the struggling one, while the struggling department faces worsening conditions without the support.
    - A technique to leverage the successful department without directly firing members of the struggling department.
- When there are bothersome elderly members in a community, create a new community in a place they dislike.
    - It is often difficult to directly remove elderly members from a community, but with this pattern, they exclude themselves by choosing not to join the new community.

    - Early adopters maintain quality by moving to new places since they cannot terminate the bothersome majority.
    - Communities that fail to transition to a [[Gated Community]] will eventually be abandoned in this manner.
