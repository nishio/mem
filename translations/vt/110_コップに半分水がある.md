Different people have different thoughts when looking at a [[Glass Half-Full of Water]].
- A: The glass has [[Only Half the Water]].
- B: The glass is [[Half-Full of Water]].

This is a widely known [[Metaphor]].
- Where did this [[metaphor]] originate?
- According to [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/04/06/half-full/), the original author is unknown, as the earliest instance found is anonymous.
    - > Quote Investigator: The earliest match found by QI appeared in “The Evening Sun” of Baltimore, Maryland in April 1929. The statement occurred in a filler item without attribution. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:
    - > If he says his gas tank is half-full he’s an optimist. If he says it’s half-empty he’s a pessimist.
    - (DeepL) If he says his gas tank is half-full, he's an optimist. If he says it's half-empty, he's a pessimist.

An easily imaginable metaphor:
- However, the glass defines 100%.
- As a result, it implicitly leads to the judgment that "aiming for 100% is good" (filling the glass with water is good).
- The idea that "filling the glass with water is good" is an act of [[Focusing on Deficiency]].

It is sometimes used in the sense of [[Knowing Contentment]].
- In that case, focusing on [[deficiency]] might generate a [[Desire for Growth]], leading to criticism that without focusing on deficiency, there is no growth.
- [[Gap Between Ideal and Reality]]

    - An evolved form of this metaphor
    - However, the level of abstraction is higher
- [[Drucker]] has commented on this
    - > 6. Changes in Perception
    - > “The glass is half full” and “The glass is half empty” are descriptions of the same phenomenon but have vastly different meanings. Changing a manager’s perception of a glass from half full to half empty opens up big innovation opportunities.
    - 2002 [The Discipline of Innovation](https://hbr.org/2002/08/the-discipline-of-innovation)
    - (DeepL) By changing a manager's perception from the glass being half-full to half-empty, big innovation opportunities arise.
    - This suggests that recognizing it as "half-empty" is more beneficial.
