- Some people believe that adding to A to create B makes it better.
- Others think of it as a "contextless addition."
    - If it connects to form C, they believe "it's better than A."
    - At the B stage, it might feel worse.
        - Because they value tightly connected networks.
        - Strictly speaking, it might not be worse.
            - The cost to discard the addition and revert to A is low.
    - The cost of a contextless addition "A→B" is far less than linking "B→C."
    - Even when adding new elements, it would be better to link them to existing ones.
        - This is essentially [[0と1と100]].
        - Since B is added to A, its value has increased rather than decreased.
            - It increases from 0 to 1.
        - However, there are ways to increase it further.
            - There are ways to turn 0 into 100.
- Should this be included in [[観測範囲が狭い]]?
    - The context is not visible.
    - What is "context"?
        - Is it a lack of understanding of the [[知識のネットワーク]]?

    - Simply adding without doing the latter is not very beneficial.
