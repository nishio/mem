- About Frozen Gapao Rice
    - Wife: "I thought you might not have noticed because you don't look at the frozen section in the convenience store."
    - Me: "I do look at the frozen section in the convenience store."
        - "However, when I look, I'm intending to buy frozen Taiwanese mixed noodles, so I didn't notice the Gapao rice."
    - Result: The outcome is the same—"I didn't notice the Gapao rice."
