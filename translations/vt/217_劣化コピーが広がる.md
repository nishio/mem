- When there is something valuable, X, and it is possible to create a [[deteriorated copy]], over time, these deteriorated copies are produced, expanding the boundaries of concept X.
- In places where people do not actively acquire information, like the [[Shoeshine Boy]], these deteriorated copies arrive first.
- Therefore, due to the [[problem of observation range]], the value of X is underestimated.
- This is a [[pessimistic misunderstanding]], where X's value is underestimated, leading to a reluctance to read the original X, and thus, the misunderstanding goes unnoticed.

[[Elders Are Sensible]]
> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1755583734538252567) I can somewhat understand the feeling that there are many shady people promoting object-oriented programming, but having seen the statements of people like Fowler, Eric Gamma, Joshua Bloch, and many others considered "elders" in object-oriented circles in the English-speaking world, I think they are generally "sensible."
- > [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1755594129604788569) By the way, object-oriented programming is a methodology (or some kind of framework), and at least no sensible researcher has ever claimed it to be "science," so the criticism of it being pseudoscience seems to be a misunderstanding.
- > Also, among such people, there seems to be a belief that "if it's not science, it has no value."
