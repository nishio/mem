There are gains along the [[path]], so it's okay to [[pivot]] in the future.
- It's not necessary for the [[goal]] to be [[clearly defined]] in advance, because you may pivot in the future.

People who don't see the value along the path only focus on the goal.
- They try to directly extract value from the goal.

Gains along the path:
- Should they be kept secret?
- Even if they're not secret, if they're not common to everyone, there's no point in mentioning them, as there's no benefit in doing so.
    - This is also a kind of [[bias towards easily drawable pictures]].
        - When physically traveling the same path:
            - Beautiful scenery is a shared asset for everyone traveling the same path.
            - If you pick flowers blooming by the roadside, it's a competition of who gets there first.
        - However, when [[value lies in connections]], the connections that occur vary for each individual.
            - Since fully disclosing everything each person currently holds is burdensome and lacks incentive, even if not actively kept secret, it becomes [[shrouded in mist]].
