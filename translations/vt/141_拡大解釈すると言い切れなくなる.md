- It is possible to say "it is black" within a certain area, while also saying "it cannot be definitively called black" over a broader range.
- Side A has reached its current conclusion through various accumulated insights, but does not explain every dependency, leading to broad interpretations.
- Side B, unaware of the discussion so far, interprets broadly and says, "this part cannot be definitively called black."
    - While this statement is True or False, it is True but misaligned.

The world is generally a gradient, so if you broaden the scope enough, the conclusion "it cannot be definitively stated" becomes True, which is [[obvious]] and [[True but with little information]].
- By narrowing the scope, "if limited to here, the black is intense!" "I see, then let's utilize that!" is how the world progresses.
