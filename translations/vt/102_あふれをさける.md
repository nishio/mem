title: "Avoiding Overflow"

- There is a container that can hold 20
    - The container currently holds 10
    - There is now an opportunity to gain 20
- A: Let's gain 10 now!
- B: Let's [[postpone]]
    - If we try to gain now, 10 will overflow and be lost, which is wasteful
    - It's better to consume the 10 already in the container before gaining more

Which is better depends on the situation, but it seems that B is often chosen inappropriately
- B tends to overlook "losses due to delayed action" or "the possibility of losing the opportunity to gain 20 while postponing"
