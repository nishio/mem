[[Pareto Improvement]] Has a [[Range]]

![image](https://gyazo.com/0786ceac8d64714aa0c98e3202c5e2f9/thumb/1000)

- There is a [[trade-off]] relationship between Value X and Value Y.
- If the current situation R is not [[Pareto Optimal]], improvements can be made without worsening any value.
- Such improvement P is not uniquely determined.
    - Even if a single decision-maker chooses based on their personal values, the condition of "not worsening anyone's values" is still met.
- Being Pareto Optimal is not a sufficient condition for being P, as shown in specific example Q1.

The [[Feasibility Frontier]] expands outward with technological progress.
- Therefore, past decisions always become "not Pareto Optimal R."
- Is there always more than one option for "improvement" P?
- Choosing from this P does not harm anyone.
    - Could this justify dictatorial decision-making?
        - It seems unlikely.
            - (Pending) By making quick, dictatorial decisions,
            - The range of the next P is narrowed by decision-making.
                - There is a trade-off on another layer where a large gap from a Pareto Optimal state has disadvantages, but reducing decision-making options also has disadvantages.
