> ...Simply reminding users of their past thoughts can lead to stagnation in thinking. It is important to present new information at the right time and in the right amount, based on an understanding of the user's thought process.

When a [[Levee]] Breaks, Water [[Spreads]]

- If a levee is already submerged, breaking it won't spread water
- If a levee is beyond the reach of water, breaking it won't spread water

[[Only Knowledge Just Beyond Current Understanding Can Be Absorbed]]
