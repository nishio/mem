- 1: When there are [[Erupting Individuals]]
- 2: A [[Field]] forms around them
- 3: Once the field is established, the erupting individuals tend to [[Move]] to its [[Periphery]]

next: [[Considering Eruptions at the Periphery as Internal or External]]

- Why does this happen?
    - For erupting individuals, or [[Creators of New Things]], "[[Newness]]" holds value
    - As the eruption fills the surroundings, the [[Space]] for new creations diminishes
    - Therefore, they move to where there is space
        - If there is synergy with existing elements, they move to the periphery
        - If they judge there is no synergy, they may move further away
            - From the perspective of those who remain, it appears as if they have "disappeared"
            - This means they are erupting elsewhere, outside the view of those who stay
            - Once the eruption is complete and synergy is discovered retrospectively, they may return to engage in [[Trade]]
