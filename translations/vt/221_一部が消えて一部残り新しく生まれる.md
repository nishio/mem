- Example: Jobs disappear due to AI
- The claim "X disappears" often has a [[low resolution]]
    - [[Subject is too broad]]
- Increasing the resolution reveals:
    - Part A of X disappears
    - The remaining part B stays
    - A new part C emerges
- In other words, X simply [[moves]]
    - It's also a [[problem of observation range]]
    - Things that move outside the observation range become invisible
    - For those whose observation range remains within the old range of X, it seems like X disappears

The distinction between X and X' is important
- There is no clear epoch of transition; it moves smoothly, so both concepts are referred to by the same term

next: [[Shift in Concepts]]
