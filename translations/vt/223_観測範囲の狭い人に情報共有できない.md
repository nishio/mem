- Person A observes only X
- Person B observes both X and Y
- Sharing information about Y is prohibited for some reason
- Therefore, even if both A and B behave rationally, their opinions differ
- This kind of situation happens, doesn't it?
    - The fact that it happens is something you can't understand unless you're in B's position
    - As a result, A compares their rational judgment based on their observation range and considers B, who makes a different judgment for unknown reasons, to be irrational
    - This judgment itself is a mistaken judgment caused by the narrowness of the observation range

Unable to [[share information]] with [[people with a narrow observation range]]
