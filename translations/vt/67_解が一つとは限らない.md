- When thinking in terms of [[Linear Functions]], there is usually only one solution.
- Considering [[Quadratic Functions]], most cases result in "no solution" or "two solutions."
    - A quadratic function having "only one solution" is as rare as a linear function having "no solution."
    - Similarly, in general functions, having "only one solution" is a rare case.
- In other words, the behavior of linear functions is rarer among all functions, yet humans tend to mistakenly perceive things as if they were linear functions.

[[“No Solution” Is Correct]]
[[Not Necessarily One]]
