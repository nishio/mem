- 1: Discover item X [[Dropped Near Your Feet]]
- 2: As you [[Crouch]] to pick up X, you notice Y and Z [[Dropped a Little Further Ahead]]
    - Crouching = [[Lowering Your Posture]] = [[Thinking Specifically]]
- 3: [[Gather the Dropped Items]]
    - [[Stack the Collected Items]]
- 3B:
    - When a third party B views the stack from step 3, only the [[Pyramid's Peak]] is visible
    - Hidden by [[Fog]]

Attempting to obtain the pyramid's peak directly is impossible
- [[Taking the Pyramid's Peak May Not Meet Expectations]]
For person A, who is picking and stacking, it seems [[Easy]]
- "There are plenty of items dropped, just pick and stack them"
- Those who do not [[Crouch]] are hindered by the [[Fog at Their Feet]] and cannot see the dropped items
    - A vertical version of the [[Fog of Literacy]]

[[Those Who Pick Up but Do Not Stack]]
- To a third party, it appears as if they are doing nothing, hidden by fog
- People who try to [[Place a Box in Mid-Air]] without picking up
    - The fog obscures the boxes below
- [[The Ant, Spider, and Bee Metaphor]]
