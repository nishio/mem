Recently, I was intrigued by a concept I referred to as "[[Nomads]]", but the boundaries were slightly off. The appropriate name for the concept I was seeking is "[[Mobile People]]".  
- The antonym is "[[Settled People]]".  
- Mobile people do not necessarily engage in [[Nomadism]]. [[Caravans]] are also an option.  
    - They do not necessarily move over land. [[Traders]] who engage in [[Trade]] by ship are also mobile people.  
        - [[(7.2.5) Knowledge Trading Strategy Across Organizational Boundaries]]  
    - [[Movement Expands the Range of Observation]]  
        - The [[Observation Range]] of settled people is narrow.  
- Mobile people connect and [[Network]] the "settled people" who would otherwise become [[Isolated]].  

[[Movement]] and [[Settlement]]

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639251123222745089) @0xtkgshn The discussion about "mobile people" from two years ago has connected with the recent thoughts on nomads!  
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639251273777049600) Isn't this about how to know the [[Choices in Life]]?  
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639255655969341440) Exactly. Mobile people expand their observation range and learn about [[Choices]], while settled people's perspectives are narrow. This connects with the idea of creating value by [[Carrying Knowledge]], and the recent thoughts on "nomads" have been abstracted into "mobile people", including caravans.  
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639266613085044740) By moving across physical spaces, communities, currencies, and languages, one can see the places and entities they were in from a relative (objective) perspective. I believe the concept of movement is highly valuable! This insight was thanks to a question about [[Cognitive and Choice Disparities]] I received at my previous job at @hassyadai.  
- [[Only Visible Through Movement]]  

> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639255086797922306) It's important to value those doing "strange" things.  
> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639256422197383168) From the perspective of settled people, [[Visitors]] appear as "[[Strange People]]".  
- [[Rare Visitors]]  
> 0xtkgshn Yes, it means that [[Meaning Resides Only in Differences]].  
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639267004967165952) Applying this to consensus systems and decision-making, the challenge at @[[DeCartography]] was "isn't something supported by various entities a good thing?" In simple terms, it involved identifying identities within the Ethereum ecosystem and collaborating with @[[Gitcoin]] to decide "which public goods to support?"  
> [0xtkgshn](https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639268164692328450) Cartography is a Greek term meaning the art of map-making.  
>  Mapping these identities is akin to the ideas of Hiroki Azuma's [[Visualization of the General Will]] and Yusuke Narita's [[Algorithmic Democracy]].  
>  The on-chain behavior history on Ethereum is [[Permissionless]], which is used to adjust voting power in Gitcoin's [[Quadratic Funding]].
