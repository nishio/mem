- Person A says, "There is a [[gap]] between P and Q," to which Person B responds, "No, P is also [[not zero]]."

Concrete Example
- Person A: "Women feel a strong sense of anxiety when walking at night."
- Person B: "Men feel anxious too."

Person A points out that there is a [[gap]] in perception between genders, such as "women feel stronger anxiety compared to men" or "a higher percentage of women feel anxious." Meanwhile, Person B interprets A's statement as a claim that "men do not feel anxiety" and argues against it.
