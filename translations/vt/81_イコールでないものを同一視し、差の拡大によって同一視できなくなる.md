- The central expansion and contraction arrow is not quite right, but this is a pattern where "things that are close but not equal are [[identified as equals]], and through the process of expanding differences, what was once identified as equal can no longer be seen as such."
- A related topic is the case where the possibility of error is not zero, yet it is identified as zero, and through processes that expand this difference—such as playing a game of telephone over a long reporting line—problems occur with a frequency that makes it hard to believe it should be zero.
- Conversely, there is theoretically a case where "things that were not identified as equals become identifiable as such through the reduction of differences," but I can't think of any particularly interesting examples.

- Context [Initial](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/951234675980173312)
    - In response to the claim, "I am surprised that just randomly repeating seemingly equal fund transfers creates disparity!" I argued that this is not surprising at all.
        - tokoroten: The claim implicitly argues that "even with seemingly high equality in rules, disparity arises, surprising," so the rebuttal "disparity arises if the result's equality is low in WTA" is not off the mark, is it?
        - The claim is akin to saying, "a rule that seems to have high equality in results is not actually equal but '1 close to 0,' and saying 'adding 1 close to 0 repeatedly resulted in 100, surprising!' is the same. It's obvious because you are adding a non-zero value."
        - I explained it as "it's the same as adding 100 from the start," but if the listener identifies 0 and 1 as equals and thinks 100 and 1 are different, this explanation won't convey the message. Understood.
        - To explain again, unless you distribute the same amount to everyone, no matter how equal it seems, the variance is non-zero, so if you add independently to the owned money, all "disparities expand." In most cases, disparities expand, and recognizing that the opposite is only in a very few special cases is necessary.
