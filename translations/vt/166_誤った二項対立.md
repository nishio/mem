Person A believes that X and Y are opposing and "distant" from each other. However, Person B thinks that X and Y are closely related, and there is an opposing Z.

Examples:
- [[Forced Early Departure and Low Autonomy]]
    - A contrasts "strict no-overtime days X" with the "forced overtime Y" of a black company.
    - B perceives both X and Y as states where autonomy over when to work is taken away, contrasting them with the flexible work hours Z.
- "I don't want to live, but I don't want to die either."
    - Person A sees it as a dichotomy between "wanting to live" and "wanting to die."
    - Person B says, "I don't want to die," "I don't want to live," "I just want to disappear."
        - An active vs. passive dichotomy
        - Recognizes both "living" and "dying" as active actions
            - (Whether this recognition is correct is off-topic)

- "[[Dog's Buddha-Nature]]" is a false dichotomy
    - Whether a dog has Buddha-nature or not is a false dichotomy
    - See [[Sound of One Hand]]

Q: What is the relation to [[False Dichotomy]]?
- The critique of "false dichotomy" implicitly assumes the existence of a boundary, questioning "Is there really a boundary?"
- "False dichotomy" does not deny the original opposition itself
    - An additional axis of opposition is introduced
        - [[There Is Not Just One Axis]]
    - It suggests to those who implicitly see the original opposition as "large" that "it is a small opposition, and there is a larger one."
        - Whether it is large or not may be subjective
