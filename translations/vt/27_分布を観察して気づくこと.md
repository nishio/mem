- 1: Before actually [[observing the distribution]], one might think "There are A, B, C, and D."
- What happens when you actually observe it?
    - 2: An [[insight]] like "I thought there was B, but it's more like B'."
    - 3: An insight like "I thought there was C, but it's not a single entity; it's divided into C1 and C2."
    - 4: An insight like "I thought A and D were separate, but they are closely connected, so it might not be appropriate to consider them separately."

There are types of [[insights]] that can be gained by [[visualizing opinion distribution]] through a [[scatter plot]].
- Simply handing over a scatter plot and telling the end-user to interpret it is challenging.
    - Perhaps more support should be provided.
