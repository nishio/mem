[[Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]]
- Person A: "I think 0 is not good."
- Person B: "But isn't 100 not good either?"

This diagram is called "0 and 100," making it easy to see that there are other options in between.
- Is 30 better, or 50, or 70?
    - This is currently ambiguous.
    - Neither Person A nor Person B has articulated this.

In reality, the difficulty in seeing "ambiguous and unarticulated options" often leads to the perception of "there is Option A and Option B."
