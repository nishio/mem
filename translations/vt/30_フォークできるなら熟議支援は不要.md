- 1: There is an X shared by multiple people
- 2: Some people are happy and some are unhappy about moving it in a certain direction
    - As a result, it becomes stagnant if it doesn't move in either direction [[Stagnation]]
- 3: If forking is possible, then each can fork and move in their preferred direction
    - Maximizing the amount of happy people
- So why can't we adopt this "obvious solution (3)"?
    - In situations where there is a perceived need to support deliberation, there must be something preventing this solution, and it should be clarified

For example, X cannot be "OSS source code"
- Because it can be easily forked
- Some might think of it as a "community"
    - In reality, forking does happen
        - [[Examples of Community Forking]]
    - One can also choose to belong to both
