When something is difficult to accomplish in the current world, project it into another world, perform the task there, and then bring it back to achieve it.

In the Cartesian coordinate system, rotations are difficult to handle, so you convert to the polar coordinate system, perform the rotation there, and then return to the original coordinate system.

Through Fourier analysis, you can transform time series data (data in the time domain) into the frequency domain. For example, convolution integrals become simple multiplications in the frequency domain.

In the [[NM Method]], to resolve [[conflict]], you ask "What is it like?" to map it into the space of [[analogy]], search for a resolution to the conflict there, and then consider whether that resolution is useful in the original space.
