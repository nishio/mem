title: "What Is the Intersection of Meaning?"

from [/unnamedcamp/What Is the Intersection of Concepts?](https://scrapbox.io/unnamedcamp/概念の交差点とは何か？)
> It is intriguing whether the intersection of concepts is a concept, a meta-concept, or something else entirely.
I am unsure if the metaphor of the "[[Intersection of Concepts]]" refers to the same thing I have in mind, but if it does, then "the intersection of concepts is a concept" <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/unnamedcamp/nishio/icon' alt='/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
- Regarding the word "concept," I use a different definition in my Scrapbox, so for distinction, I rephrase it as "the intersection of meaning is meaning."
- First, meaning can appear unrelated or overlapping and related depending on the perspective.

- The term "intersection of concepts" on this page seems to be a metaphor used to refer to the phenomenon where, upon observing from a different perspective, relationships appear between "meanings" previously thought unrelated.
- At this point, "meaning" is still a "blurred circle" without clearly defined boundaries.

        - [[Blurred Circle]]
    - Since drawing with this blurred circle is unclear, I will depict it using "dense zones and sparse zones."

            - [[Dense and Sparse Circle Diagram]]
        - Unlike "concepts" used in mathematics with clearly defined boundaries, the "meaning" we usually deal with has both dense and sparse areas like this.
- So far, we have gathered the tools to describe the "intersection of meaning."
- As for what the "intersection of meaning" is:

        - [[Study Group on "Experiential Process and Creation of Meaning" #6233f244aff09e00009fa2ae]]
    - It refers to the new "dense region" L that emerges when the peripheral sparse parts of two "meanings" A and B overlap.
    - Like A and B, this L is also a "blurred circle," so "the intersection of meaning is also meaning."
- Aside: The term "concept" is used to refer to something with clearly defined boundaries through careful definition.
