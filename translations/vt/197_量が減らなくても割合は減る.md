[[Proportion Decreases Even If Quantity Does Not]]

- Even if the quantity of something A does not decrease, if the quantity of something else B increases, the proportion of A in the total of A and B decreases.
- While this seems obvious when viewed in a diagram, some people focus on the words "decrease or not" and make ambiguous distinctions between [[quantity and proportion]].
- When discussing "decrease in proportion," whether the quantity decreases is irrelevant. Even if the quantity of A increases, if the quantity of B increases faster, the proportion of A decreases.
