title: "The Abstractness of 0, 1, and 100"

The Title's Abstractness Doesn't Match the Content
- I thought it might be part of the [[Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]], but it wasn't.

- When comparing 1 to 0, 1 seems large, but compared to 100, it is small.
    - From the perspective of 100, debating the size difference between 0 and 1 is a trivial matter.

Original Post
- There are strategies A, B, and C with expected returns of 0, 1, and 100, respectively.
- What someone pursuing strategy C feels:
    - B is futile; one should choose C.
- What someone sticking with A feels:
    - They haven't realized the returns of B or C.
    - The investment needed to achieve the returns of B or C seems large compared to the returns.
    - Therefore, they choose A.
- What someone remaining at B feels:
    - They haven't realized the returns of C.
    - They feel "B's return is greater than A's" and thus affirm their current strategy.
- What someone who has experienced "A→B→C" feels:
    - B is better than A.
    - Since one cannot leap directly to C, one should start with B ([[Overgeneralization of Personal Experience]]).
