T1
- [[Early Adopters]] are experimenting and playing with various things concretely.
- People who benefit from [[Moving People]] pick up a random keyword C, [[Obfuscate]] it, and create a [[Buzzword]].
- As people gather and repeatedly use buzzword C, the original meaning of the word C is lost.
- The [[Cognitive Resolution]] of the gathered people increases, and they settle on a concrete concept.
    - The word C becomes difficult to use as it starts being used in both [[Narrow and Broad Senses]].
    - The [[Late Majority]] arrives late and uses the word C.

This is similar to the [[Series of Pictures Where Two People Say Different Things]].
[[Nested Concepts]]
[[Evolution of Concepts]]
