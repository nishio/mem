- 1: A and B appear to be in conflict
- 2: Enhance the [[Resolution of A]]
    - A is [[Divided]] into A1 and A2
- 3: A2 and B are in conflict, while A1 is unrelated to the conflict

When considering "how to resolve a conflict," we tend to try to eliminate the "conflict" itself. However, by dividing the conflicting elements and enhancing the resolution, and then asking again "which elements are actually in conflict?", we may discover elements that are not involved in the conflict.
