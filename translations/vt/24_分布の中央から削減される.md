- A: When Reducing a Fixed Amount From the Distribution
    - Excessive reduction occurs at the periphery of the distribution
- B: When Reducing by a Fixed Ratio From the Distribution
    - Excessive reduction like in A does not occur
    - However, a decrease in reduction width occurs at the periphery
- C:
    - When reductions are made, there is often an incentive correlated with the reduction width
    - Therefore, in reality, a decrease in the reduction rate occurs at the periphery
    - As a result, the central part of the distribution is significantly reduced
