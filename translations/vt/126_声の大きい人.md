When comparing a loud person A and a quiet person B, assuming they have identical abilities, the idea that "the louder person gains recognition faster and has an advantage" (P) can coexist with the notion that "in the long term, they will be recognized equally" (Q).

I saw on social media that B, who is not good at [[self-promotion]], claimed regarding A that "in the long term, it will be the same" (Q). However, this claim does not negate the fact that there is currently a difference due to P, and if you integrate over time, it is clear that A's recognition is greater.
- Since I have not personally observed these two individuals and have only seen B's claim, it is possible that Q's "in the long term, it will be the same" is merely B's wishful thinking. It seems more likely that A will leverage their early recognition to reach a higher "long-term level."
- Given that even unrelated outsiders perceive it this way, B's behavior is generally not very beneficial.
