- To make content engaging, it's efficient to pit the very red against the very blue
    - This happens automatically on Twitter<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon' alt='/villagepump/基素.icon' height="19.5"/>
- However, when this actually occurs, it doesn't feel very pleasant
- Light red individuals might think, "I don't want to make extreme claims like the very red ones," or "I dislike being lumped together with the red camp by the blue camp."

[[Extreme Individuals Stand Out]]

- [[Extreme]]
    - The tag "[[Extreme Individuals Stand Out]]" was already there but couldn't be found
    - Found through a link from "[[Saying Extreme Things Attracts Attention]]"
    - "[[Extreme Opinions Stand Out]]"
        - [[Extreme Opinions]]
