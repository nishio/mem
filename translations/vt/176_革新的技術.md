The idea that a major programming language can become 100 times faster:
- It starts by optimizing the easiest parts and uses benchmarks where improvements appear most dramatic.
- When used widely, the speed increase is not as significant as expected.
    - "AI processes written in Python becoming 100 times faster?!"
    - No, they don't. This is because the majority of AI processing involves matrix operations, which are already implemented in fast libraries written in C or Fortran.
- If used well, it can be faster in some cases.
    - It requires knowledge to use effectively.
    - When it becomes a matter of needing knowledge, comparisons with similar tools like [[Numba]] or [[PyPy]] become necessary.
    - Until such comparisons are seen, it's best to reserve judgment.
