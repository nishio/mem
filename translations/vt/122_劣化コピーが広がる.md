- When there is something valuable, X, and a [[degraded copy]] of it is possible, over time, these degraded copies are created, expanding the boundaries of concept X.
- The degraded copy reaches the "[[shoeshine boy]]" who does not actively seek information first.
- Therefore, due to the [[problem of observation range]], the value of X is underestimated.
- This is a [[pessimistic misunderstanding]], where X's value is underestimated, preventing one from reading the original X and realizing the misunderstanding.

[[Big Names Are Sensible]]
> [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1755583734538252567) I can understand the feeling that "there are many shady people promoting object-oriented programming," but after seeing the statements of Fowler, Eric Gamma, Joshua Bloch, and many others, I think those considered "big names in object-oriented programming" in the English-speaking world are generally "sensible"...
- > [kmizu](https://twitter.com/kmizu/status/1755594129604788569) By the way, object-oriented programming is a methodology (or some kind of framework), and at least no sensible researcher has ever claimed it to be "science," so the perception of those criticizing it as pseudoscience is itself off.
- > Also, among such people, there seems to be a belief that "if it's not science, it has no value."
