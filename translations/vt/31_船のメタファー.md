[[Ship]] [[Metaphor]]

- 1: There is an obstacle in the course
    - 2: Avoid it
    - 3: Destroy it
- 4: The obstacle was also a ship carrying other people
    - Choosing to destroy (3) leads to war
        - Fight or avoid
        - Even if we choose to avoid, they might attack us
            - [[Prisoner's Dilemma]]
- The problem with the ship metaphor is having clear boundaries
    - Interaction makes attacks impossible
    - The cost of attacking increases, making it not a viable option
    - The issue was that ships and [[national territories]] had [[clear boundaries]]
        - [[Enemies and allies]] become distinctly separated
        - Movement of people blurs these boundaries
            - "There are my comrades on that ship too"

It sounds like a good story, but the thought process leading up to it wasn't pleasant
- [[Desire to Advance Civilization]]
    - The ship (1)
- There is an obstacle
    - Let's destroy it (3)
- However, the obstacle was a ship carrying "Homo sapiens"
    - In fact, our ship was about "advancing Earth-originated civilization"
