- When drawing two axes, we tend to unconsciously make them orthogonal
    - Because that's what we are accustomed to seeing
- However, such diagrams implicitly make a strong assumption that "X and Y are independent"
    - "When you increase or decrease Y, X does not change"
    - In reality, this is not always the case
