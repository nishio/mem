The center represents the [[average]].  
Near the center, the population density is high (more people per unit area).  
However, since the [[peripheral areas have a larger surface area]],  
the number of people living in the peripheral areas is greater.  
An [[average group]] is not necessarily the [[majority]].

----- Conversation that sparked this idea  
When [[values become diverse]], [[eccentrics become the majority]].

Q: If that's the case, wouldn't the [[eccentrics]] in that region become the [[normal people]]?

No, having a large number of people does not equate to being [[normal]].  
- Here, "normal" means [[average]].

Q: Are you imagining the distribution as flattening out?

You're probably thinking of that distribution in a one-dimensional space,  
but consider a three-dimensional sphere divided in half by distance from the center; the outer part is seven times larger.  
The average is at the center.  
Even if the number of people per unit volume is higher at the center,  
the volume of the peripheral area is larger,  
so "eccentrics become the majority."

A more neutral expression would be "average people become the minority."  
The terms eccentric and normal carry biases.  
Eccentric → People whose [[sensor]] output deviates from the average output  
Normal → People with average output
