The Assumption That a Singular Entity Exists at the Top  
The Belief That What Is at the Top Is Singular

This is unconsciously fostered by the worldview of [[hierarchical organizations]] and monotheistic beliefs in "creation of the world by a single god."
- The value system that "created beings are inferior to the creator."

A worldview where diverse implementations exist on top of a singular infrastructure
- If social systems are implemented on Ethereum's [[world computer]], they can be easily forked, allowing for [[diversity]] to be realized.

[[Servant Leadership]]
- The idea that the leader's role is not to stand above but to support other members.
