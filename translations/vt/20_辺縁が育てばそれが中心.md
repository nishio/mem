- When the Periphery Grows, It Becomes the [[Center]]  
    - What is considered the center is not universal and changes over time  
        - What was once the center is no longer the center  
        - Kyoto was the center of Japan, but with Tokyo's growth, it is no longer the center  
    - As the periphery grows, the [[Center of Gravity]] shifts to the periphery

- 1: There is a legitimate X, and at its periphery, there is "Y as a subspecies X' of X" (X'=Y)  
- 2: "Y as a subspecies X' of X" begins to grow  
- 3: Gradually, the interpretation shifts to include both the old X and the new X, which is Y, within X  
    - It is important that in stage 1, Y took the position of "Y as a subspecies X' of X"  
    - This leads to the emergence of "X in the narrow sense excluding Y" and "X in the broad sense including both old X and new X'"  
    - I feel like I've drawn a related picture...
