title: "Cognitive Resolution"
---

Even when looking at the same thing, the perception can differ depending on whether a person's [[cognition]] has high or low resolution.

- Based on the discussion of [[Differences Between Resolution and Resolving Power]]:
    - It is appropriate to title this page as [[Cognitive Resolving Power]] or simply [[Resolving Power]].
- However, it is clearly explained using a display analogy in some parts.
    - This is because I perceived the camera process and display process as a unified process, using them interchangeably without distinction.
        - This itself is an example of low resolving power.
- It seems difficult to correct everything at once.
    - Let's write it like this for now and gradually correct it.

Previously, I was drawing two-dimensional pictures, but I thought a one-dimensional version was better.
- I realized it could be included in the [[Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]], so I redrew it.
- After drawing, I noticed there was a similar diagram in [[“Similarity” Is Not a Fact]].
- Improvements made: In previous diagrams, the boundaries themselves were misaligned, which gave it a different meaning than "difference in resolution." This time, the boundaries are aligned.
    - Because [[Even with the Same Resolution, There Are Individual Differences in Segmentation]].

I had written the following on a page called [[One-Dimensional Version of Cognitive Resolution]]:
> The diagram I wrote in [[“Similarity” Is Not a Fact]] was hard to understand upon review, so I added to it.
> In [[Cognitive Resolution]], it was drawn in two dimensions, but here it is drawn in one dimension. The concept expressed is the same.

- Even when photographing the same thing, the appearance differs if the camera resolution is high or low.
- Similarly, even when looking at the same thing, the appearance differs if a person's [[cognition]] has high or low resolution.
- [[Fluctuation in Interpretation of Semantic Proximity]] is also caused by differences in [[resolution]].

- Example of low resolution:
    - "A big bug flew over!"
- Example of high resolution:
    - "An [[Oleander Hawk Moth]] flew over, it's harmless."
    - "A [[Hornet]] flew over, and it's making a clicking warning sound, dangerous!"
    - [Oleander Hawk Moth - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%90)
        - A large insect seen in urban shrubbery.
        - Some people mistake it for a wasp and are frightened, but it is harmless.
    - [Hornet - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A1%E3%83%90%E3%83%81)
        - > Hornets exhibit strong defensive behavior around their nests or territories. If approached within 10 meters, they take defensive actions and fly around the intruder. ... Hornets may produce a "clicking" warning sound by clashing their mandibles, which is the final warning stage. If ignored, they will summon other hornets for a group attack (this warning sound is actually considerate, as they often attack without warning. Therefore, if you hear this sound, you should leave immediately).

There is also a related page called [[Resolution of Reality]].

- On 2019-04-22, I wrote an example of the [[Oleander Hawk Moth]] from the Sphingidae family.
- Below is the Oleander Hawk Moth.

- Below is the Sphingidae family Hummingbird Hawk-Moth.

    - [https://www.insects.jp/kon-gahosihou.htm](https://www.insects.jp/kon-gahosihou.htm)
- I couldn't distinguish between these two.
    - When someone asked "What is this?" after watching the video below, I almost answered "Oleander Hawk Moth," but someone else answered "Hummingbird Hawk-Moth" first.
    - Upon investigation, both belong to the [[Sphingidae]] family.
        - In other words, I likely recognized creatures with Sphingidae characteristics as "Oleander Hawk Moth."
        - A typical example of low resolution.
