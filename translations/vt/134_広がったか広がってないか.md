- The person on the left believes that it has "expanded" from A to B.
    - In reality, specific example c is not included in A but is included in B.
- The observation range of the person on the right is different.
    - Within this range, B has not expanded much.
    - Specifically, example d is not included in either A or B.
    - Hearing the left person's claim of "expansion," the right person interprets it as a claim that "d is included in B" and counters with, "No, it hasn't expanded, and d is not included in B."
- From the left person's perspective, "I did not claim that 'd is included in B,'" and criticizing something not claimed is a [[straw man argument]].
- Taking an overview:
    - The claim of "expansion" usually does not mean "expansion in all directions."
    - The existence of "parts that have not expanded" does not negate the claim of "expansion."
