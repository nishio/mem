The original title was "Dialectic by Continuum," but it felt too rigid, so it was changed to "Moving in Reverse, Yet Reaching the Same Goal."

A dialectic arising from the suspicion that what we perceive as a "point without size" might actually have size.

The reason why X and not X, moving right and moving left, have opposite meanings is based on the premise that the starting point is a single point. However, if the starting point is a continuum, the action "aiming for the center" (C) means moving left for the right end and moving right for the left end. Here, an Aufhebung occurs where "both X and not X are C."
