title: "Nested Concepts"

The current title is too abstract for the content, so it will be changed if a better one is thought of.

This concept is related to several others:
- [[What Was Thought to Be One Concept Is Two Nested Concepts]]
- [["Being X" and "Not Being X" Can Coexist]]
- [[Liskov Substitution Principle]]

There are additional discussions not covered in those:
- When Person 1, who is considering the narrow definition of X, talks with the premise that "the elements of X are A," Person 2, who is considering the broad definition of X, thinks, "Person 1 is assuming 'the elements of X are A,' but that is incorrect, let me correct them."
    - This leads to [[Violence of Justice]] because they believe they are doing the right thing.
- When Person 2, considering the broad definition of X, asserts that "there are elements of X that are not A," Person 1, considering the narrow definition of X, thinks, "Such things obviously do not exist, Person 2 is wrong, let me correct them."
    - Or they might think it's because of [[Low Cognitive Resolution]].
- [[Each Thinks the Other Is Inferior]]

[[Series of Pictures Where Two People Say Different Things]]
- The statements are complex.
- Although there has been an attempt to express this without using natural language, this time it results in:
    - $\forall x\in X, x\in A$ vs. $\exists x\in X, x\notin A$
- This is the structure it takes.
- Hmm, well, maybe with the diagrams, even those who struggle with math can understand? (Can they??)
