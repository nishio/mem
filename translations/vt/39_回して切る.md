Attempting to cut in one direction reveals a [[core]] inside.
- There is a hard part that is not visible from the outside, which resists cutting.
    - [[Resistance Forces]]
- In this case, by rotating the blade, you can cut around only the soft outer parts.
- Leave the hard part alone.
    - Exposure to air weakens the hard part.
        - [[Environmental Change]]
        - [[Transparency]]
    - Alternatively, create an opportunity for someone else to cut it.
    - Find a different type of blade.
        - Observe the core closely and find a [[suitable tool]] to cut it.
- Or, cut again.
    - With the surrounding parts gone, force acts directly on the core.
