- 1: There is a conflict between A and B
- 2: A different perspective C is created
    - [[Dialectical Development]]
- 3:
    - At this point, the original "conflict between A and B" does not disappear
        - Therefore, if you focus on that, it seems like the [[Discussion]] is "stuck in a [[Stalemate]]"
    - It is moving in a [[Different Direction]]
        - Whether it is "progressing" can be determined by whether a [[New Idea]] that did not exist before the conflict is being generated
