"Learning from everyone" is more a mindset than a fact. By adopting the attitude of learning from everyone and engaging in activities to learn, you can bring beneficial effects to your life.

To learn from everyone, it's important to focus not on "what you have that others don't," but on "what others have that you don't." This requires training. In the default state, the difference between knowledgeable and less knowledgeable people is clear when it comes to things you are familiar with. However, for things you are not familiar with, the difference is unclear, leading to a bias where you perceive yourself as generally knowledgeable. 

One solution is to take an interest in others' past experiences. Regarding their past experiences, they are the most knowledgeable in the world, and you know nothing unless you learn from them. This structure is obvious, making it less likely to fall into bias.
