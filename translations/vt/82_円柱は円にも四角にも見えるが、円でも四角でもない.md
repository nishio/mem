A [[cylinder]] can appear as a [[circle]] when viewed from one direction, and as a [[rectangle]] from another. 

"It appears as a circle" — this is correct.  
"It appears as a rectangle" — this is also correct.  
"It is a circle" — that is incorrect.  
"It is a rectangle" — that is also incorrect.

Whether humans can observe "it is a cylinder" is uncertain.
