Let's assume that supporters of policy A are a minority compared to those who do not support it, not A.
- In such cases, there is a tendency to think about converting not A people to support A.

However, is it appropriate for A to be fixed in the first place?
- [[Correctability]]
- Consider slightly modified versions of A: A1, A2, A3.
- Regarding A1, all supporters of A also support it, and the number of supporters increases.
    - There is no reason not to change A to A1.
- Regarding A3, the number of supporters increases, but it is a minority among A supporters.
    - This is unacceptable.
    - Ultimately, if A were replaced with not A, the number of supporters would increase, but A would never accept that, right?
    - In other words, the number of supporters is not a single evaluation axis; the support rate within A is important.
- What about A2, where a majority within A supports it and the number of supporters increases?
    - I currently think A should accept the modification to A2, but I'm not yet convinced.
    - I'm concerned about what happens to those who are cut off in the update from A to A2, B (A and not A2).
        - However, if A2 is a minority, these cut-off people B would become part of the majority.
