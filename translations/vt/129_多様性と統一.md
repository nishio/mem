[[Recognizing as a Set Is a Mistake]]
- Viewing Diversity from the Unity Perspective
    - When perceived as a set of humans, it appears that this set is fragmented, and the "people inside" seem to be decreasing.
- Viewing Unity from the Diversity Perspective
    - "A set of points with different positions"
    - It seems as if there is an attempt to restrict these "positions" to a narrow range, ultimately converging to a single point.

I thought it might become a [[Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]], but I couldn't quite illustrate it well.

Is it better for character encoding to be unified across countries?  
Is it preferable for one browser to dominate the market share?  
Should one social media platform hold the share and decide what to filter?  
etc.
