Decentralization  
Centralization vs. Decentralization is a False Dichotomy  
Whether a system is decentralized and whether the systems built on its infrastructure are decentralized are separate issues.  
When something composed of multiple layers is vaguely perceived as a single entity without identifying the layers, discussions about it can diverge.

While writing, I realized that the ambiguity in the definition of "centralization" is involved here.  
- Confusion arises from calling relationships on different layers by the same name.  
- The discussion about whether servers are centralized or decentralized, or whether information is centralized like real estate registration or decentralized like ownership of movable property, is about layers.  
- It's about whether power is concentrated in specific players or widely distributed among many.  
- There is a similar dichotomy of "centralization and decentralization" across these different layers.  
- It's not good to confuse these different opposing relationships across layers.  
- Ownership of movable property is decentralized, but monopolization of wealth can occur on that infrastructure, which is unrelated.  
    - If those with resources can more easily acquire more resources, then resources become centralized.  
    - If power is influenced by the amount of resources (which is often the case), those with more resources hold greater power.
