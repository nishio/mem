1:
- Person A says various things to person B, who has less knowledge than themselves
    - "B, who lacks knowledge, is inferior to me."
    - "You should study properly."

2:
- However, this might simply be because A only sees what they are good at
    - [[Observation Range Problem]]
    - In [[King of the Monkey Mountain]], it's expressed as "not seeing outside the mountain"
    - In [[Literacy Fog]], it's considered as "perhaps not even visible in the first place"
        - [[A Frog in a Well Knows Nothing of the Great Ocean]] expresses "not knowing," but is it because they aren't trying to know, or because they can't know?
- In this situation, all claims A makes against B for having "less knowledge" become a [[Boomerang]]
    - However, due to A's narrow perspective, they cannot observe this
    - B might be able to observe it
        - But often, B perceives A as an "unpleasant person" and doesn't feel like "teaching them"
- This is also related to [[The Midcore Ideology of 'Do It Properly']]
    - Ultimately, acting based on the perception that someone has "less knowledge" from one's own viewpoint might be misguided
    - It might be better to teach when asked, and otherwise remain uninvolved
