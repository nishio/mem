- On a curved path, the inside course (A) can advance faster than the outside course (B).
- Therefore, we tend to think of this as the "[[Fastest Course]]".
- However, this is merely a case where A is better than B under the [[constraint]] of the "course".
- When you remove the constraints, going straight on C is the [[fastest]] and overwhelmingly quicker.
- Compared to C, the difference between A and B is insignificant.

- Is that "constraint" truly immovable, or is it an illusion created by the human mind?
- A runs on the inside of the course, feeling superior for being slightly ahead of B.
    - However, unseen, C, who has left the course, is far ahead.
- A thought they were the best, but suddenly C appears so far ahead that they can't catch up.
    - A considers C to be [[unfair]].
- From C's perspective, A and B are not much different.
    - They took a [[detour]] along the [[illusory rails]]. Thus, they are slow due to their own [[responsibility]].
