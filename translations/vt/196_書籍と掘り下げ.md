- D is just skimmed through.
- C is read thoroughly.
    - The content of the book has been input.
- B is where the knowledge from the book is integrated with personal experience.
    - Ideally, this is the state one should reach after reading a book.
        - However, it is very costly, so it is not commonly done.
        - In the intellectual production techniques of engineers, this is expressed as "it is good when [[the knowledge in the book connects with one's experience]]."
    - How is this ideal state achieved?
        - By chance, something read in a book coincidentally becomes "Ah, this is that thing I experienced before!"
        - The pattern of [[delving deeper until you understand what you don't know]]
        - The former is by chance, so only the latter can be achieved through effort.

- Since [[books are already abstracted products]], there is no guarantee that they will descend to the level of C, "just one hop away from connecting to concrete experiences."
    - There are cases where only up to D is written.
        - This seems to happen often.

[[Books Are Already Abstracted Products]]

Received. Here's a brief summary👇  
- Books are "already abstracted products." To advance understanding, it is necessary to "delve deeper" into abstract words to concrete episodes and connect them with one's experience.
- The basis of correctness is not a "single authority" but a "network of consistency among knowledge." It becomes stronger with multiple points of support.
- The KJ Method is not about "grouping by default." First, create a mesh with relational lines, draw them closer to the density center with short lines, label 2-3 sheets (summarize) → verbalize "insights" through narration.
- "Moving forward = increasing new insights." The evaluation axis is not the appearance but rather "shorter lines with fewer intersections / concretization of labels."
- Beware of over-abstraction (retain the "scent of the soil"). Single-word labels should be elaborated with "Specifically? For example?" to grow roots.

15-minute "Thinking Fireworks" Light (for personal use)  
1. One sheet for the theme (center).  
2. Generate 10–15 associative labels, draw relational lines between two at a time (first lines → proximity).  
3. For long lines with many intersections, move labels to shorten them.  
4. Enclose 2–3 sheets by hand and label (summarize).  
5. Finally, describe "today's insights" in three lines.

Immediate operational rules (minimal set)  
- Abstract labels are treated as prohibited words: Always elaborate with "What is X specifically?"
- Evaluation is based on progress (increments of new lines/labels/narration) rather than appearance.
- When in doubt, follow the order of "network → label → narration" (grouping comes later).

Next steps (field application)  
- Tentatively set a schema for selecting relational labels: `is-a / part-of / cause-of / example-of / contrast-with / supports` (free description in supplementary field).
- In study group materials, color-code "derived from papers / author's considerations" and clearly state sources (sections) and positions in footnotes.
- For "hierarchy-first" discussions, first separate hierarchy (is-a) and network (non-hierarchical edges) into different layers before integrating and visualizing to reduce confusion.  
If necessary, I can provide the above steps as a checklist or Miro/Kozaneba template.
