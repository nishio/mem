[[Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]]

> [toriyamayusuke](https://twitter.com/toriyamayusuke/status/1457215214676365317?s=21): The debate between those who say "It's okay to use katakana pronunciation with confidence" and those who argue "No, katakana pronunciation won't be understood, it's no good" has been repeated many times regarding foreign languages. In reality, it might be said for many languages that "there are situations where katakana pronunciation is okay and situations where it's not, and ultimately, you won't know the difference unless you study properly."
> tinouye: At the very least, starting with "katakana pronunciation is okay" seems to allow for a quicker start in speaking. So, I think it's better to begin with katakana pronunciation and learn about the issues gradually.
