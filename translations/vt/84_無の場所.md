When considering the [[extremes]] of the particular and the general, the limit of the particular is the [[individual]], while the limit of the general is the "Place of Nothingness," according to the philosophy of [[Nishida Kitaro]]. An entity X that "exists" is accompanied by a place Y in the form "X exists in Y." If Y exists, it is accompanied by a place Z. If there is a limit in this direction of generalization, and if it were something that exists, then there would be something beyond it, thus it can only be nothingness.

In terms of a metaphor from mathematics, this is similar to the question, "The extreme on the smaller side of the natural number sequence is 0. So, what is the extreme on the larger side?" For any natural number X, there exists a natural number X+1 that is larger, so the "extreme on the larger side" cannot be a natural number. To handle such concepts, mathematics introduced the concept of "[[Infinity]] ∞," which represents something larger than any number.
