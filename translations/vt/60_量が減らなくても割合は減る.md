- Even if the quantity of something A does not decrease, if the quantity of something else B increases, the proportion of A in the whole of A and B decreases.
- In the diagram, this seems obvious, but some people focus on the words "decrease or not" and have unclear thinking about the distinction between [[quantity and proportion]].
- When discussing "decreasing proportions," whether the quantity decreases or not is irrelevant. Even if the quantity of A increases, if the quantity of B increases faster, the proportion of A decreases.
