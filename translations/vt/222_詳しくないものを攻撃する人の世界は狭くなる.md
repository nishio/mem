Cases of Attacking Without Proper Understanding
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/7b823a75cb3cda646afb440365c94641/thumb/1000)
- This is an issue of A's [[Observation Range]]
    - The observation range is narrow, so the subject is not well understood
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/794d6e4eb41cec2adc80f98c8398c11f/thumb/1000)
- The view from someone with a broad observation range
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/b5f08e08596798e060896b30ad2ee628/thumb/1000)
    - A attacks something they "don't understand well"
        - The "don't understand well" is subjective to A
        - Since [[Most Things in the World Involve Humans]], most attacks target humans
        - From B's perspective, it appears as if "I was attacked"
        - C, who was observing, thinks "A is attacking B, this isn't good"
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/32f3fedebc27f84c1e1e9ca2999ca6de/thumb/1000)
        - C builds a wall to protect B
        - A metaphor for [[Building a Wall]]
            - Avoiding [[Opportunities for Contact]]
            - 2025-08-10 [[Gated Community]]
        - For example, if D, who is unaware of this interaction, thinks "maybe we should invite A to this community"
            - If B is part of this community, C might advise, "No, given what happened, it's better not to"
            - D would then decide, "Oh, then I'll pass!"
            - A weak reason like "it might be interesting if they're here" is easily negated by such specific issues
            - D doesn't want to side with A in this conflict
        - In this diagram, B is depicted as a single person for simplicity
            - In reality, A's attacks often resemble a [[Shotgun]] blast affecting many people
            - C says, "Hey, you just attacked about 20 million people, do you realize that?"
            - Many [[Doors of Possibility]] are simultaneously locked
            - [[The World of Those Who Criticize Closes Off]]
