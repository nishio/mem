title: "Each Thinks the Other Has a Narrow Perspective"

- Person A thinks Person B has a [[narrow perspective]], and B also thinks A has a narrow perspective.
- Things outside one's own [[field of vision]] are usually not observed, and even if they are observed by chance, they appear blurry and are often [[underestimated]].

I feel like I've drawn this diagram of [[intersecting sets in a cross]] elsewhere.
- Here it is:
    - [[A Encompasses B]]

There was also a Venn diagram representation of the inability to observe outside one's own set.
- Perhaps this one: [[You Cannot Know Everything Others Know]]

Trigger:
- A person A talked to B about the behavior of C.
    - B described C as having a "narrow perspective."
- However, from A's viewpoint, C travels around the world and could be considered to have a "broad perspective."
    - This information was not disclosed to B.
    - C would probably also think B has a "narrow perspective."
        - Based on C's own past activities.
- In other words, both feel the other has a narrow perspective simply by ignoring what is difficult for them to see.
