[[Judgment Supported by Multiple Perspectives]] with [[Different Observational Ranges]]
- Derived from [[Cannot Know the Entirety of What Others Know]]

Person A believes that option X is good based on their own [[observational range]] of information.
- Person B thinks option X is not good based on their observational range of information.
- In this case, B will not adopt A's proposed X.
- If A truly believes that adopting option X will benefit B, it is better to share the information that supports this belief with B.
    - [[Share Judgment Materials, Not Judgment Results]]
        - Since [[Good Judgments Are Supported by Many Facts]], to derive better judgments, it is necessary to increase judgment materials rather than judgment results.
- If A does not do this, B will judge that "A is speaking without any particular basis."
- This could indicate a [[Symmetrical Relationship]].

    - Both think the other's judgment is lacking in basis.
    - It is more productive for B to ask A, "Why do you think that is good?"
        - Instead of waiting for A to provide, B should actively seek the information.
        - Well, since there are countless people, it is rational to prioritize those who seem capable of having productive conversations over those who strongly assert themselves.
