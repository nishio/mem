Example  
from [/villagepump/It's Better Not to Write Your Own Programs](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/プログラムを自分で書かない方が良い)
- Incidentally, solutions claiming "there's no need to write programs anymore" appear roughly every few years, but we haven't reached a world where programming is unnecessary<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon' alt='human.icon' height="19.5"/>
- We haven't reached a world where programming is unnecessary. This shows that the meaning of "[[programming]]" shifts at each point in time<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>
    - Writing [[machine language]] directly is no longer done
        - Because [[FORTRAN]] was created, achieving "[[automatic programming]]"
        - This is what we now call "compiling"
    - Most programmers no longer write [[memory management]] programs
        - Because [[GC]] was invented, and languages like Java and Python that adopted it became mainstream
    - The activities once called "programming" have changed, and now only the parts left to humans are referred to as "programming"
