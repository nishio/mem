The dialectical method involves considering a proposition (thesis) and its negation (antithesis), then discarding both to rise to a higher level (sublation: Aufheben) to obtain a new proposition (synthesis). This concept of "conflict and its resolution" is famously associated with Hegel's dialectic but is widely used beyond that.

The [[TRIZ]] approach views patents as "conflicts between physical performance characteristics and their resolution," attempting to extract patterns of what can be used for which conflicts.

The [[NM Method]] aims to resolve conflicts in real-world problems by mapping the problem into an analogy space to devise solutions.
