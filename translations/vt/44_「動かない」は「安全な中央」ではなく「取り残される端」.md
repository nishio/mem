"[[Staying Still]]" Is Not the "[[Safe Center]]" but the "[[Left Behind Edge]]"

> [nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1731491445050392933) [[People Who Don't Move]] believe they are at the [[Center]]. And they think the center is [[Safe]]. However, this is a mental model from an old era when "[[Exploration]]" was two-dimensional movement. In reality, the space for exploration has become higher-dimensional.

Physical exploration on the earth's surface was two-dimensional, so we are still influenced by that era's perception.

Believing "We are not at the edge, we are at the center, therefore we are safe," they end up at the edge.

People who don't move are "people who don't explore" and are perceived as "being outside the space" and "not particularly noteworthy."

This perception has become possible because the space is higher-dimensional.
