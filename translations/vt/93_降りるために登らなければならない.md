This diagram is used in discussions about activation energy. For example, if you want to burn charcoal to obtain energy, you first need to heat the charcoal. Even though you want to gain energy, you must initially provide energy. This initial energy provided is called activation energy.

If a person standing on the top of a small hill wants to reach a higher place, they need to descend the hill and climb a taller one. To ascend higher, you must first descend.

In general, when you are in the most X state locally and wish to become more X, you must first move in the not X direction.

As a physical [[metaphor]], there's the idea that "you must crouch before you can [[jump]]."

In literary terms, there's the expression "it's darkest before the dawn" (though, is this really true?).
