- Rephrased Understanding
    - We often assume that '[[Same]]' and '[[Different]]' cannot coexist, but this is because we assume X and Y are single points. However, when both are [[sets]], a situation can arise where the sets are not [[equal]] but significantly [[overlap]]. In such cases, focusing on the common part makes them 'same', while focusing on the rest makes them 'different'.

- When saying "X is (the same as) Y," if we perceive X and Y as single-point symbols, we tend to think "X=Y."
- However, if the single-point assumption is incorrect,
    - When X and Y are sets,
- There might be a discrepancy between X and Y.
- In such cases, it is possible for X to be (almost) the same as Y and for there to be differences between X and Y.
- It is not 'same' but rather 'the sets significantly overlap', and in softer terms, they are '[[similar]]'.

The title was changed from "The Root of 'Same' and 'Different' is the Same" to "The Coexistence of 'Same' and 'Different'" on 2022-02-17.
