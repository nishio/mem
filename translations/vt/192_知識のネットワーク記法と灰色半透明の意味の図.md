- I realized that the diagrams (1) and (2), which I often draw, express the same thing in different ways.
- I believe we should first give these diagrams names.
    - (1)
        - Represents a [[Knowledge Network]]
            - [[Knowledge Network Notation]]
                - I don't frequently tag this, as I consider it a "common expression" and often use it without explanation.
                - Circles represent knowledge or concepts, and lines represent relationships.
        - The initial version was [[Rootless Knowledge]] (2014)
            - Related to [[Knowledge Pyramid Notation]], it features characteristics of [[Diagrams with Abstract at the Top and Concrete at the Bottom]], but often becomes a non-hierarchical expression to represent what cannot be expressed otherwise.
        - Recently drawn examples
            - [[Digging Deeper Until Understanding the Unknown]]
            - [[Books and Digging Deeper]]
    - (2)
        - [[Gray Translucent Meaning Diagram]]
            - Recently named
            - During the [[Concept Map Study Group]] process for the [[Plurality Book Concept Map]], I reflected on the explanation from the "Study Group on Experiential Process and Meaning Creation," where this notation was invented and has been used long-term, leading to the belief that this method should have a name.
        - Created as a result of considering how to effectively convey explanations during the study group, specifically in [[Study Group on Experiential Process and Meaning Creation 3]] (2022).

The logic that these are equivalent is explained in the "Experiential Process and Meaning Creation" (4B4) [[Relation or Relata]].
- This was explained using the [[Diagram of Dense and Light Circles]] invented at that time: [[The Relationship Between A and B and the Aspect of A Created by B Are the Same]].
- In the Knowledge Network Notation, meaning is narrowly interpreted, while in the Gray Translucent Meaning Diagram, it is broadly interpreted.

(3)
- In the context of reading a book, the author assumes that the reader does not possess concept S, and attempts to convey it through aspects created by concepts A, B, and C, which the author assumes the reader does possess.
    - There are cases where the reader does not possess A, contrary to the assumption.
        - Such readers cannot understand S.
            - Due to the finite nature of books, there must be a cutoff point.
            - Authors feel that possessing prerequisite knowledge is the reader's responsibility.
            - However, there is no easy way for readers to know what the author considers prerequisite knowledge, leading to potential frustration when readers buy a book and fail to understand it.
                - Since it is not explained, the reader is not at fault.
            - It is also something the author cannot resolve, so the author is not at fault either.
        - The author believes readers should research A.
            - While not mandatory, readers should accept that they cannot acquire S without doing so.
            - Some readers believe, "I won't pay the cost to research A, but the author should pay the cost to convey S."
            - From the author's perspective, they think, "There's no way I'm paying that cost."
        - These considerations were explored in [[Digging Deeper Until Understanding the Unknown]] and [[Books and Digging Deeper]].

    - There are cases where readers believe they possess A, but the meaning intended by the author differs.
        - This is troublesome.
        - There are cases where the reader is wrong, the author is wrong, or neither is wrong.
        - In cases where the reader is wrong, they believe they know the concept and do not seek further information.
        - The resolution process is depicted in "Feelings When Reading a Book" and the subsequent "Development of Discomfort."
            - At that time, Knowledge Network Notation was used.
            - In 2019, the Gray Translucent Meaning Diagram had not been invented yet.
        - I believe it can only be resolved by recognizing discomfort and seeking consistency.
            - This relates to what was written in [[Knowledge Consistency]].

At present, I believe this is related to [[CIRCUMLOCUTION]], but confirmation is needed.
