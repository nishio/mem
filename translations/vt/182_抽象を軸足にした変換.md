title: "Transformation Anchored in Abstraction"
---

The [[Transformation with an Anchor]] becomes a [[Climb and Descend Metaphor]] when the [[Anchor]] is [[Abstraction]].

Concrete examples C1 and C2 are distinct entities:
- When [[Something New]] is created, it is a [[Different Entity]] from the [[Existing Things]].
- If it is not a different entity, it is not the [[Creation]] of something new.
- [[The Same Thing Is Not New]].

However, if C2 is a different entity from C1, wouldn't C1's [[Experience]] be useless?
- In reality, this is not the case; concrete experiences from past actions can be beneficial in actions involving new, different entities.
- So why does this happen?
- It is because the [[Model]] A, created through [[Abstraction]], connects them.
