- Over time, X accumulates and grows, allowing A and B to connect more deeply through a larger X3.

Concrete Example
- Person A and Person B meet by participating in a common event X1.
- They discover a shared hobby X2 through conversation.
- They participate together in an event X3 related to that hobby X2.
- Through this process, Person A and Person B become friends.
