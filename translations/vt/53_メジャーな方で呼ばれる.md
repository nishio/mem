- At a certain point, there is a trade-off between X and Y due to technical constraints.
    - There are two types: B, which emphasizes X, and A, which emphasizes Y, and they are considered separate entities.
- As technology advances, the line of the [[trade-off]] changes.
    - The [[feasibility frontier]] expands.
    - At this point, a new option C becomes possible, combining the X of B and the Y of A.
    - There is no clear rule about whether to call C "A" or "B," so people tend to call it whatever comes to mind.
        - Therefore, it is generally referred to by the "more popular" name.
            - Suppose it is called A.
                - Attribute X has greatly improved, while Y is maintained.
                - There is an attribute Z not depicted in this diagram, where A scores high, but C does not.
                - People accustomed to the traditional A see the newly named C and say, "But Z is low."
                    - [[People Who Focus on Deficiencies]]
                - Those who moved from B to C do not care about Z in the first place.
    - (It seems another diagram is needed for this "change in terminology.")
        - [[Dragging Past Dichotomies]]
        - In this case, there was no dichotomy, which is slightly different.

Specific Example
- A: Manga
- B: Content combining ASCII art with dialogue
    - Such as the "Learning with Yaru-O" series
- C: Content combining AI-generated images with dialogue
- A had the advantage of "combining images and text."
    - The goal was to achieve this advantage, but the cost of drawing was high.
    - Thus, ASCII art was used as a cheap "substitute for images."
    - This led to the birth of B.
    - B has the advantage of "low production cost" compared to A (X).
    - A has the advantage of "beautiful images" compared to B (Y).
- Technological advancements made "AI-generated images" possible.
    - The ability to generate beautiful images cheaply led to the creation of C.
- People originally involved with A feel discomfort in calling C "A."
    - Because they did not find value in axis X.
    - They first think "C is not A" and then try to justify it by saying "it is inferior on axis Z."
        - In the case of manga, they might criticize C for having "monotonous compositions."
        - Evaluation axis Z "quality of composition" is introduced.
    - However, those involved with B do not evaluate axis Z.
        - Therefore, they feel that bringing up axis Z is off-topic and irrelevant.
