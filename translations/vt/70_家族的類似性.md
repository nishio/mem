title: "Family Resemblance"

---

The concept that whether an element belongs to a group is not determined by common features. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] pointed out in his work '[[Philosophical Investigations]]' that concepts like "language," "games," and "numbers" do not share common features across all their subjects but are loosely connected by partially shared features. He named this concept [[Family resemblance]]. [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E7%9A%84%E9%A1%9E%E4%BC%BC)

The diagram asks whether the target resembles Group 1 or Group 2.
Asians tend to choose Group 1, while Westerners tend to choose Group 2.

Exploring the two ways of thinking

There are four attributes:
- Attribute 1: The target's petals are round; 3/4 of Group 1's petals are round, 1/4 of Group 2's petals are round.
- Attribute 2: The target's flower center is a single circle; 3/4 of Group 1's centers are single circles, 1/4 of Group 2's centers are single circles.
- Attribute 3: The target has leaves; 3/4 of Group 1 has leaves, 1/4 of Group 2 has leaves.
- Attribute 4: The target's stem is straight; 0/4 of Group 1's stems are straight, 4/4 of Group 2's stems are straight.

In this situation, should the target be placed in Group 1 or Group 2?
- Asian Style: Since 3 out of 4 attributes indicate "closer to Group 1," it should be placed in Group 1.
- Western Style: Attributes 1-3 do not clearly distinguish the groups. Attribute 4 is the criterion that separates the two groups, so according to this criterion, it should be placed in Group 2.

The Western style is easy to explain to others: "If the stem is straight, it belongs to Group 2" is a clear proposition. However, it is weak against noise. In this example, Attribute 4 neatly separates the groups, but if noise prevents separation by Attribute 4, the Western style may lead to a deadlock, thinking "there is no clear criterion to distinguish these two." It is also weak if some attributes are unobservable. If Attribute 4 happens to be unobservable, the decision may reverse.

The Asian style is strong against noise and unobservability but cannot simply explain the reasoning. If forced to explain, it would be: "If the petals are round, give 1 vote to Group 1; if the flower center is a single circle, give 1 vote to Group 1; if there are leaves, give 1 vote to Group 1; if the stem is straight, give 2 votes to Group 2. The group with the most votes is chosen."

The relationship between if-statements, [[decision trees]], and [[logistic regression]].
- Related: In [[Asians Use Logistic Regression, Westerners Use Decision Trees]], it is confirmed that logistic regression aligns with the Asian style, while decision trees align with the Western style.
