> [vMP2JOuXu4icoEr](https://x.com/vMP2JOuXu4icoEr/status/1832690554976735578) In discussions about [[Selective Marital Surname System]], I often feel that quite a few men naturally believe it's their right to interfere with others. When a woman says, "From here on, it's my domain, so I'll decide," they feel as if their rights have been violated. The [[Boundary Between Self and Others]] is too weak.

They simply want to live with the surname they were born with, which is something most men take for granted.

> [vMP2JOuXu4icoEr](https://x.com/vMP2JOuXu4icoEr/status/1833321530635522236) It's alarming that the obvious notion of fulfilling one's own desire to "have the same surname as a spouse" by changing one's own surname doesn't naturally make sense. (Moreover, by unconsciously substituting "one's own desire" with societal or partner's demands, they avoid taking responsibility for making their partner change their surname, which is even more alarming.)
