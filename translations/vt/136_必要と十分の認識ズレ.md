title: "Misalignment in Perception of Necessary and Sufficient"

---

> [MUGI1208](https://twitter.com/MUGI1208/status/1707539464216850886) A subordinate is frustrated, saying, "I followed my boss's and seniors' instructions, but in the end, we had to redo a lot, and we didn't achieve our goals!!" When I asked the boss, they said, "I didn't give such instructions. Besides, the subordinate doesn't do anything not explicitly instructed, doesn't think about how to finish by the deadline, progresses in a single-task, linear fashion, and just waits passively when dependent on others. It seems like they haven't grasped how to manage work yet. What should I do?"

The subordinate is doing what's necessary but can't reach sufficiency. The boss thinks they're providing sufficient direction but isn't ensuring the subordinate does what's necessary. It's easy to blame communication, but the root cause might be that both are satisfied with themselves without achieving what's needed.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>This tweet discusses the misalignment in perception and communication issues between a subordinate and their boss.
- MUGI1208's tweet:
    - The subordinate followed the instructions from their boss and seniors but failed to deliver the expected results, leading to dissatisfaction. From the boss's perspective, the subordinate only follows given instructions and doesn't take initiative for other necessary actions. The boss feels the subordinate lacks experience or knowledge in managing work effectively.
- pumpkinmayo's tweet:
    - This user uses the metaphor of "necessary" and "sufficient" to describe the gap in perception between the subordinate and the boss. The subordinate believes they are doing what's "necessary," but it doesn't feel "sufficient." Meanwhile, the boss thinks they are giving "sufficient" instructions but may not be conveying the "necessary" actions to the subordinate. The lack of communication is the issue, and the problem stems from both parties being satisfied with their efforts without achieving the necessary outcomes.
- MUGI1208's reply:
    - The original user agrees with pumpkinmayo's explanation, finding it fitting to their situation.

In essence, this tweet highlights how misalignment in perception and lack of communication can cause significant issues in the workplace. It shares perspectives from each side, their frustrations, and advice for resolution.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/>"Necessary" and "Sufficient" are terms used in many contexts, but here we explain their basic meanings and usage in the context of the tweets.
- Necessary
    - Basic meaning: Something indispensable to achieve a goal or condition.
    - Context in the tweets: The subordinate perceived tasks and actions communicated as instructions or demands by the boss as "necessary." In other words, doing what the boss said was the "necessary" requirement for their job.
- Sufficient
    - Basic meaning: Having enough quantity or quality to meet a goal or condition.
    - Context in the tweets: The boss expected not only the perfect execution of given instructions but also the ability to adapt flexibly to other situations and tasks. This "ability to adapt" is considered what fulfills the "sufficient" condition.

Applying these terms to the context of the tweets, the subordinate felt they were doing the "necessary" (tasks as per the boss's instructions), but from the boss's perspective, those efforts were not "sufficient."

In conclusion, what is deemed "necessary" to achieve a goal and what is "sufficient" to completely fulfill that goal do not always align. This is an example of a perceptual misalignment that can occur in many situations, not just in the workplace.

Ah, I see, this is what it means<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

- A believes following [[instructions]] is "[[sufficient]]"
- Meanwhile, B considers following instructions to be "insufficient"
    - From B's perspective, A doesn't seem to consider what is "[[necessary]]" to make it "sufficient"
