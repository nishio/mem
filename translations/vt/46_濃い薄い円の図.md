In reality, it is a [[blurred circle]] where boundaries are not clear. However, if we depict it as a blurred circle, humans cannot recognize it well. Therefore, it is expressed with overlapping dense and sparse areas.

This was created to explain the [[aspects of experience]] during the [[Study Group on "The Process of Experience and Creation of Meaning" 3]].
- It was likely inspired by [[The Intersection of Stories Becomes an Atom]].

The [[nested sets]] depicted in [["X Is" and "X Is Not" Coexist]] can be interpreted as the boundary lines of the two colors in this diagram.
- Essentially, if it is a [[blurred circle]], then those lines do not actually exist.

[[Neither "X Is" Nor "X Is Not" Is Correct]]
