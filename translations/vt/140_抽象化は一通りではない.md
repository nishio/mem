There are countless ways to [[abstract]] concrete information. It varies from person to person.

Starting a discussion based on [[incorrect abstraction]] is futile, yet somehow it happens. Why is that? Abstraction is the reduction of information. When concrete information exceeds an individual's cognitive capacity, they unconsciously discard information and abstract it. The less familiar one is with a field, the higher the probability of making "incorrect abstractions," so one should think more concretely. However, unfamiliar fields impose a higher cognitive load, leading to unconscious abstraction.

Among those proficient in a field, there is a shared method of "abstraction commonly used in that field." Therefore, by using [[common abstraction]], information can be reduced, enabling efficient communication. The premise of "efficient information transmission through abstraction" is that there is a "common method of abstraction."
