I couldn't share the mental image I had in my mind through words, so I drew a picture afterward.

- The horizontal axis represents "Improvement," and the vertical axis represents the "Value" gained from it.
- The most prioritized action should be D→E.
  - It has the steepest slope.
    - In other words, it is the most efficient improvement.
- B→C also has a similar slope.
  - However, it assumes the condition "currently at B."
  - Usually, in a newly started project, you are at A or D.
- E→F has the lowest priority.
  - Because it has the smallest slope.
  - It is a task that should be done with part of the surplus of an already profitable product and should not be done in the early stages of a project.
- A→B also has a similar slope.
  - But extending to A→C results in a medium slope.
  - It should be prioritized over A→B when there is room to invest long-term, though it has lower priority than D→E.

It is not good to lump these together under the same name without distinction.

  - [[Mixing Them in a Jar]]
- We must recognize them with high resolution and prioritize them.
- It is problematic to call A→C and D→F by the same name and equate them, but even if they can be distinguished, there are cases where the stages are not recognized.
  - It is perceived as "Do A or do D."
  - It becomes "Let's do D first."
  - After doing D to some extent, it becomes "Stop doing D."
    - In this case, it is not verbalized distinctly, but E has been reached.
  - It becomes "We should do A."
    - "We discussed whether to do A or D and decided on D, so why stop D?"
    - "Why stop doing D?"
  - Actually doing it
    - "Compared to the response when doing D, A has no response," "Shouldn't we be doing D?"
      - In this case, it is not distinguished, but it is still in the A→B phase.
