The difference between progressing from the general to the specific or from the specific to the general when constructing a tree.

[[Jiro Kawakita]] argued that classifying data using a [[top-down]] approach assumes an [[existing structure]], which can hinder the discovery of [[new structures]]. He emphasized building data using a [[bottom-up]] approach, which led to the creation of the [[KJ Method]].

On the other hand, [[Tony Buzan]]'s [[Mind Mapping]] and Barbara Minto's "The Pyramid Principle" recommend constructing trees using a top-down approach.

Additionally, this card itself is constructed using a bottom-up approach. First, specific examples of noticing blind spots or shifts in perspective are collected, and then abstraction is performed.
