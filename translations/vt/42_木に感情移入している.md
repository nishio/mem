title: "Empathizing with Trees"
---

derived from [[Tree Metaphor]]
- Empathizing with [[Emotions of Trees]]
    - I thought of myself as having low [[Empathy Ability]], but could it be that I actually have a high empathy ability for non-Homo sapiens?
    - Or rather, do I have a certain level of empathy ability even for non-Homo sapiens?
    - Because "the majority of Homo sapiens have strong empathy abilities towards their own kind, Homo sapiens," does it become "[[Comparatively Weak]]"?

- "Thinking from the [[Computer's Perspective]]" is an empathy ability towards computers
    - People who abbreviate "empathy ability" to mean only "empathy ability towards Homo sapiens" might actually have low "empathy ability for non-Homo sapiens" and are simply unaware of its existence?
