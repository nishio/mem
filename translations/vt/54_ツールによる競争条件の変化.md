Changes in [[Competitive Conditions]] Due to Tools

When a tool T enhances capability X, which is independent of capability Y, and both are constrained by a common resource (such as time investment), a [[trade-off]] relationship arises. However, if a tool that can be purchased with another resource, such as money, enhances capability X, the competitive conditions change.

People who gave up X to pursue Y may become frustrated with those who acquire X without giving it up. Those who sacrificed Y to obtain X might:

- Feel annoyed with people who obtain X without sacrificing Y?
    - This can happen in some cases.
        - For example, a career woman who gave up having a family to pursue her career might harass junior women who want to balance both.
    - Whether there is a limit to X
        - People aiming higher might not care about others and instead be happy, thinking, "I can achieve even more X with this tool T!"
        - Like manga artists who are happy to use generative AI.

Observing jealousy towards people who release code written by AI despite not having high programming skills made me ponder what that really is.
