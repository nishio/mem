title: "When Some Decrease, Others Increase"
---

When depicted in a diagram, it's simple, but when explained in words, it becomes complex, leading to confusion and strange thinking in many people.

[[Even If Quantity Doesn't Decrease, Proportion Can]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/1c306ac763c3662fb3565fa6b68337af/thumb/1000)
- Even if the quantity of something A doesn't decrease, if the quantity of something else B increases, the proportion of A in the total of A and B decreases.
- In a diagram, this seems obvious, but some people focus on the words "decrease or not" and have unclear thinking about the distinction between [[quantity and proportion]].
- When discussing "proportion decreasing," whether the quantity decreases or not is irrelevant; even if the quantity of A increases, if B increases faster, the proportion of A decreases.

The Error of Considering 99% as 100%
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/396926629757a721d3d74f2e65f3521a/thumb/1000)
- Due to a [[narrow observation range]], [[unconsciously ignoring inconvenient things]], or low thinking ability, people simplify by considering something as 100% when it is not.
- They misrecognize or claim that "something that already exists as a fact" is "non-existent."
- Their assumptions differ from those who know "it exists."

[[The Error of Assuming Quantity Is Maintained]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/6bad9ea71d62e9a6f625bf2e94a78038/thumb/1000)
- The error of thinking that what exists now will be maintained in the same quantity in the future.
- In most cases, it increases or decreases, but without considering this possibility, they implicitly assume the same quantity will be maintained.

[[Confusing Decrease with Disappearance]]
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/b1c3baf6693680f73ff4675ac2c8659f/thumb/1000)
- Some people counter the discussion of "decrease" with "I can't believe it will disappear!"
- They misinterpret the claim of "decrease" as a claim of "disappearance" and argue against it.
    - Since the premise is misrecognized, it is nothing but useless noise.
