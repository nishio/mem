- On a curved path, the inside course (A) can advance faster than the outside course (B).
- Therefore, we tend to think of this as the "[[Fastest Course]]".
- However, this is merely a matter of A being better than B under the [[constraint]] of the course.
- If we remove the constraint and think freely, going straight (C) is the [[fastest]] and overwhelmingly quicker.
- Compared to C, the difference between A and B is insignificant.

- Is that "constraint" truly immovable, or is it a fantasy created by the human mind?
- A runs on the inside of the course, feeling superior for being slightly ahead of B.
    - However, in less visible areas, C, who has left the course, is far ahead.
- A thought they were the best, but suddenly C appears so far ahead that A can't catch up.
    - A thinks C is [[cheating]].
- From C's perspective, there's little difference between A and B.
    - They took a [[detour]] along the [[fantasy rails]]. Thus, being slow is their [[own responsibility]], C believes.
