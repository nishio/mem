[[The Value of Information]] Varies [[By Person]]
![image](https://gyazo.com/cc51449522941349d938b58c5be81dfc/thumb/1000)

- Perspective of Person A
    - Holds two thoughts:
        - Indisputable important opinion X
        - Trivial thought Y
    - Person A believes X is important
    - Feels that despite conveying this to Person B, B does not prioritize X

- Perspective of Information Receiver, Person B
    - Many people have conveyed the same X as Person A
        - The first piece of information X has value, but subsequent ones are "[[Known Information]]" and thus have lower value
    - Person A conveyed X
        - Does not feel it holds value
    - Finds Y more interesting instead

In a [[Free-Response Survey]], X is written
- Person A does not prioritize Y, so it is not written

[[Personal Experiences]] and [[Personal Sensations]] have the highest potential of being "unknown," yet many feel guilty about sharing them due to being [[Personal]]/[[Subjective]]
    - Since there is only N=1, it cannot be abstracted, yet people forcibly abstract it, turning it into useless data
    - [[ASD Remembers Details While Non-ASD Summarizes]]
