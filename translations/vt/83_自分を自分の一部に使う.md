Using the same or similar elements as a part of themselves.  
This is a form of nesting, one of the concepts in [[TRIZ]]. Think of it like a retractable antenna.  
In software terms, this is known as [[recursive calls]]. Examples include quicksort, merge sort, and tree traversal.  
Prohibiting revisits through caching, dynamic programming, and DAGs are also related.

### Summary of Notes  
Exploring the concept of using the same or similar elements as a part of themselves. This is a part of nesting and TRIZ, and is expressed as recursive calls in software. It also relates to prohibiting revisits through caching, dynamic programming, and DAGs.

### Relation to Fragments  
The fragment "Reflecting on TRIZ" is related to the notes. The notes discuss the concept of nesting as part of TRIZ, while the fragment mentions the abstraction of TRIZ. Both explore the theme of using the same or similar elements as a part of themselves.

### Deep Thinking  
Concepts like nesting and recursive calls play a crucial role in problem-solving and creative thinking. They allow for breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, solving each individually to find an overall solution. This approach is useful not only in software development but across various fields.

### Summary of Thoughts and Title
