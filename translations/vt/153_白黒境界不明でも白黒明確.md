Even if black and white do not have a clear boundary, it is possible for a certain object to be clearly black.  
- In the diagram, there is no clear boundary between black and white  
    - B argues, "Y is a gray area where it's unclear if it's black or white."  
    - Despite this, A's assertion that "X is black" can still hold true  

This is due to the ambiguity in the definition of "clear."  
- B's definition of "clear in black and white" is "for any x, it is known whether it is black or white."  
- A's assertion is "for a specific X, it is known whether it is black or white."  
- B's condition is stricter

In [[Darwin's Incident]]2 p.86, a vegan argued from A's standpoint.  
- In response to B's claim, "Can ants or cabbages feel pain? Current science may not know,"  
- They argued, "Even if it's unclear whether ants or cabbages feel pain, it is clearly known that cows feel pain."
