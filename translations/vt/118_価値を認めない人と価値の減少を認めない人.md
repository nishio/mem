title: "People Who Deny Value and Those Who Deny Its Decline"

- A: "X has value!"
- B: (Yeah, it does have value, though not as much as before.)
- C: "X no longer has any value!!"
- B: (No, the value has decreased, but saying 'none' is too much. It should be more like 'not as valuable as it once was'...)
- A: "Those who say X has no value want it to have no value because they can't understand it."
- B: (See, because C said something extreme, A started saying extreme things too...)

The concepts of "value has decreased" and "value still exists" can coexist, but they become incompatible when transformed into "no value" or "value remains unchanged."

Therefore, candidly saying "I don't understand" about important matters is seen as a declaration of weakness or incompetence, especially by oneself. This is not an intellectual attitude. Intellectual inquiry begins with [[acknowledging what you don't understand]].
- Up to this point, it's a good story

> [@sugimoto_kei](https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1601837326103040001?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A): I think this is probably at the core of the "object-oriented debate" this time. It's uncomfortable to feel that object-oriented programming is talked about as if it's important, but you don't quite understand it. Hence, you want to deny that object-oriented programming is "no longer" important.
- I thought this was strange

> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1602118893270880259?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A): I thought it was a structure where people who say "it's no longer valuable" and those who say "it has the same value as before" clash, just like with many other technical knowledge where "its importance has decreased over time."
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1602120118640988160?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A): The claim "they want it to have no value out of fear of not acquiring something valuable" can easily be reversed to "they want it to remain unchanged out of fear of the value of what they've acquired decreasing," so this conflict between the two isn't very interesting.
> [@nishio](https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1602121473531215872?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A): I completely agree that "it's important to acknowledge what you don't understand," but it lacks persuasiveness if you don't apply it to yourself before using it on others. It's distorted cognition to use it against someone who estimates the value of A lower than you do by saying "you don't understand the value of A" without considering "maybe I don't understand the factors causing A's value to decrease."
