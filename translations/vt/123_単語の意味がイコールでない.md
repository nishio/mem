title: "The Meaning of Words Is Not Equal"

---

2021-12-04  
The [[meaning]] of a word X when used can [[vary depending on the person]].  
- This is often experienced as an observable fact, as seen in the [[series of drawings where two people say different things]].  
- Assuming differences in meaning, communication becomes an overwhelmingly difficult task for most Homo sapiens.  
- Therefore, despite observable facts indicating otherwise, we operate under the working hypothesis that the meanings of words are equal.  
- [[Your Life's Story (Spoiler Alert)]]  
    - [[Non-Homo Sapiens Intelligences]] might use a language system that does not rely on this odd assumption.  
    - From their perspective, it seems strange to ignore observable facts and maintain such an assumption.  

What kind of language system would that be?  
- For example, "An X and a Y initially appear to be in conflict, but then a Z emerges, which is better than either."

- This structure can be shared with others, even if the specific XYZs differ.  
    - In this example, variables are used as [[placeholders]] rather than specifics.  
    - Even without words assigned to this structure, it can be used analogously.  
        - Related: [[Allegory and Symbolism]]  
- Association  
    - A [[lambda function]] `lambda x, y: x + y` can be used without a name and regardless of the specific values of x and y.
