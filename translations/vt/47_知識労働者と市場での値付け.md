title: "Pricing Knowledge Workers in the Market"
---

The skill level of a [[knowledge worker]] is represented as a non-negative real number in n-dimensions (for simplicity, it can first be considered as one-dimensional).

- Distribution of skill levels of products (=[[knowledge workers]]) in the market
  - Generally not uniformly distributed
- Distribution of required skill levels by buyers in the market
  - Generally not uniformly distributed
- Assume that the quantity and price of products meeting the required skill level are inversely proportional
  - In reality, buyers compete in an auction-like manner based on the utility they gain from the product and other constraints, but to avoid complexity, this is simplified.

- For example, if the market has many jobs requiring "skills around 30" and jobs requiring "skills above 90," the graph of skills versus compensation should resemble the graph of the [[model where only the top players in the market gain utility]].
- If only "top people are hired," the graph will be high only at the right end.

- By attempting to draw such graphs, there is an implicit assumption that "skill level is one-dimensional"
  - In reality, it is n-dimensional, with required levels set across multiple dimensions
  - This allows for the expression of phenomena where someone is "not the top in any axis but highly valued"

    - Due to the finite time available for learning, there is a [[trade-off]] relationship between skills. On the graph, this is represented by a [[constraint line]] where skill1 + skill2 is below a certain threshold.

  - Aiming to maximize each skill leads to a red ocean situation
  - The mixing of multiple skills is surprisingly not concentrated
    - In high dimensions, contrary to intuition, the mixed region is wide ([[curse of dimensionality]])
    - In N dimensions, there are N regions that are top for each axis, but for combinations of two axes, there are N(N - 1)/2 regions. When N is 4 or more dimensions, the mixed regions outnumber the individual top regions.
