- Some people believe that adding to A to make it B improves it.
- Others think of it as a "contextless addition."
    - If a link connects and it becomes C, they believe "it's better than A."
    - At the B stage, it might feel like it has worsened.
        - This is because they value a tightly linked network.
        - Strictly speaking, it might not have worsened.
            - The cost of discarding the addition and returning to A is low.
    - The cost of a contextless addition "A→B" is much lower than linking "B→C."
    - Even when adding something new, it would be better to link it from existing things.
        - This is essentially [[0 and 1 and 100]].
        - Since B is added to A, its value has increased rather than decreased.
            - It has increased from 0 to 1.
        - However, there are ways to "increase it more."
            - There are methods to turn 0 into 100.
- Should this be included in [[Narrow Observation Range]]?
    - The context is not visible.
    - What is "context"?
        - Is it a lack of understanding of the [[Knowledge Network]]?

    - Simply adding without doing the latter is not very beneficial
