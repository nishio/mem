- Concepts used in everyday conversation do not have clear boundaries like those in mathematics
- A vague meaning M can be expressed with symbol A or symbol B
    - These two are not synonyms; there may be nuances that have not yet been verbalized
    - The two symbols are related to different "aspects" of M (related: [[Aspects of Experience]])
- Symbol C1 might connect exclusively with A, symbol C2 with B, and symbol C3 with both A and B
- (For diagrams and terminology usage in this area, refer to [[Study Group 4 on "Experiential Process and Meaning Creation"]])
