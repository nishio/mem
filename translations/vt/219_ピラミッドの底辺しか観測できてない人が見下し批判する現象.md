A story about reaching the intended page using [[2-hop links]] in Scrapbox, found by connecting [[my Scrapbox to ChatGPT]].

Person A says something like, "Those who said X are now excited about Y, they're just being swayed by buzzwords," and Person B responds, "Thinking X and Y are different is proof you're only seeing the surface, swayed by buzzwords." This made me think, "What was that concept again?"

    - Not the image I had in mind, but this is most related to the triggering event.
        - Criticizing the whole by only looking at the base of the pyramid.
    - The reason this person only observes "prominent inferior individuals" is because [[degraded copies spread]], leading to bad information being propagated to those who do not actively seek information.
