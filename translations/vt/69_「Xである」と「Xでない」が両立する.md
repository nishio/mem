Phenomenon Observed in the [[Difference Between Vice and Evil]]
- The same term X was being referred to, but it was actually two nested concepts.
- As a result, those focusing on the narrow X think "A is not X," while those focusing on the broad X think "A is X."

- This is related to: [[Question of Relationships]]
    - It's quite abstract, though.
    - > Are X and Y the same thing? Or are they different?
    - > It seems neutral but is a [[False Dichotomy]]
    - > It excludes possibilities of [[Inclusion Relationships]] or [[Overlap]]

- [[What Was Thought to Be One Concept Is Two Nested Concepts]]
    - This is more specific
    - It's close but not identical to this case
        - This is an example from one person

        - This might be essential
        - Perhaps the mistake is in perceiving meaning as a set.
            - People recognize the meaning of words through representative examples in their minds and their similarity to them.
            - A set can be formed by setting an appropriate threshold for this similarity, but the threshold is not clearly recognized.
            - Thus, it becomes a "fuzzy boundary set" as shown in the diagram above.
            - The phenomenon of "the concept of X being a nested set" is simply a difference in thresholds.
            - The difference in thresholds becomes visible only when people with the right aptitude compare meanings.

                - [[Meaning Is Not a Set]]
                - Meaning is not a set with clear boundaries but a [[Fuzzy Boundary]] with a [[Fuzzy Circle]]
                - Extending this idea leads to the "non-numerical character of meaning" explained in [[Study Group on Experiential Process and Meaning Creation#61fb7718aff09e00004a7667]]
        - [[Meaning Is a Vector]], but that alone is just a point
            - The operation "A is X" becomes a perfect match only
            - Instead, it involves several representative vectors in the mind and their similarity
            - A set is formed by setting a threshold for this similarity
                - (2023-02-04) However, humans do not have a clear threshold and determine boundaries somewhat arbitrarily
            - The representative vectors compete for space, forming boundaries similar to a [[Self-Organizing Map]]
                - They don't even decide on similarity
        - Ah, meaning is not clearly defined as a set but as a group connected by similarity, which is Wittgenstein's [[Family Resemblance]]!
            - > Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his book 'Philosophical Investigations,' discusses the term "game" (German: Spiel), pointing out that there is no common intension (meaning) that characterizes all the extensions (objects) called "games." Instead, they are loosely connected by partially common features such as "having a winner" or "entertainment," which he named family resemblance. This concept, along with [[Prototype Theory]], serves as an antithesis to the classical view of defining words by necessary and sufficient conditions.
            - [Family Resemblance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resemblance)
            - > The categories humans actually possess are not classical categories defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, but are characterized by typical examples and their similarity... For example, the word "bird" brings to mind small flying animals like crows and sparrows, while ostriches and penguins fall outside the typical examples.
