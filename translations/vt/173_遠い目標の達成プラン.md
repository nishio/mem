[[Plan for Achieving Distant Goals]]
![image](https://gyazo.com/ca2e2d6934e3e95cc369c1a981214551/thumb/1000)
- There is a person A who argues that executing [[Plan]] P1 is necessary to achieve the [[goal]].
    - To this person, P1 appears to be the best option.
- There is another person B who is considering other options like P2 and P3.
    - P2 is currently underway, and P3 is also a viable option.
    - Compared to these, P1 does not seem appealing.
- A feels that "B is not cooperative with the necessary P1 for achieving the goal."
    - From B's perspective, the priority to allocate resources to P1 is low, which leads to this perception.

This illustrates that even if the goal is shared, differences in choosing options can arise.
- Generally, goals are not shared.
