title: "Is Something That Has Changed Still the Same Thing?"

[[A Series of Drawings Where Two People Say Different Things]]
- Left: A person who thinks "A has changed to B"
- Right: A person who thinks "A has changed to a new A"

The person on the right recognizes the change as 'the current A has transformed into a new A' and still calls this new A "A." This expands the conceptual scope of A.

When I hear about "adapting democracy to a new environment," I wonder if people will call the adapted new X democracy or not.
