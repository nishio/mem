A [[dialectic]] that perceives the two opposing forces of Yin and Yang as temporal changes where each gives rise to the other. When Yin reaches its extreme, Yang is born within it (the return of Yang), and when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin is born within it. This diagram is also referred to as the Yin-Yang fish, as it is likened to the shape of a fish.
