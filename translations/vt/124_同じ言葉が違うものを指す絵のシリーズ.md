title: "Series of Images Where the Same Words Refer to Different Things"
---

The [[Series of Images Where Two People Say Different Things]] depicts scenarios where two people see the same thing but express different opinions through images.  
- However, I realized there are cases where the same words express different situations.
    - Could this simply be called a "[[Misunderstanding]]"?
- Specific Example
    - ![image](https://gyazo.com/1c46a26e73c5f94c3f5ce11f44aeb4d7/thumb/1000)
    - There is a small entity X and a large entity Y.
    - Both X and Y have Z.
        - Here, one might mistakenly assume the ratios are the same.
    - When someone says, "We ranked first in share of Y's Z," it is misinterpreted as "Obviously more than X's Z."
    - However, if the ratio of Z in Y is small, it might actually be less than X's Z.

<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> Let's consider a concrete example.
- Scenario:
    - There is a small village X and a large city Y.
    - Both have Chinese restaurants Z.
- Situation:
    - Village X has 3 restaurants, 2 of which are Chinese restaurants Z.
    - City Y has 300 restaurants, 30 of which are Chinese restaurants Z.
- Misunderstanding:
    - The village is perceived as lacking diversity with few types of restaurants.
    - It is assumed that the city, being 100 times larger, would have a similar ratio of restaurants.
        - 200 Chinese restaurants
    - In reality, there are only 30.
        - The city has a wide variety of restaurants, such as Turkish and Vietnamese, that the village does not have.
