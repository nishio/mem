- 1: The [[Binary Choice]] of "A or B?"
- 2: Is there an optimal choice between A and B?
    - Recognizing that "A or B?" is a [[False Dichotomy]], and there is a [[Third Option]] of [[Moderation]]
- 3: Realizing that "there is an optimal choice in between" might be a false assumption
    - There is an unnecessary constraint of "choosing a point on the axis connecting A and B"
        - Related: [[Trade-off Between Two Attributes]]
        - [[False Binary Opposition]]
    - Choosing to do both extremes, A and B, is a solution that is not "a point on the axis"
