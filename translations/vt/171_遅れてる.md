> [@koshian](https://twitter.com/koshian/status/1609470674040651776): What is this... The CO2 emissions from the automotive industry haven't decreased much outside of Japan, have they? What have the Western automotive industries been doing for the past decade...? And these are the ones saying Japan is falling behind...?

> [@kazuho](https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1610395313063481346?s=46&t=oK-WAPEVzyMFLxIsCDHw9g): I commented elsewhere, but while the number of cars owned in Japan hasn't changed, the average for developed countries has increased by about 30%, and the trend in emissions per vehicle is at a similar level, isn't it? It's natural for transportation volume to increase with economic development, and I feel that Japan's reduction in emissions compared to other countries is a result of economic stagnation.
