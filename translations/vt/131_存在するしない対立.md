A common pattern was identified and named <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Example 1
- [/villagepump/Isn't That Fine in Japanese? #62748c677838e300007e2688](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/それ日本語でよくない？#62748c677838e300007e2688)
> [[Factor]]: Cause  
> When using the word "factor," it is recognized as strongly related to refactoring, so rewriting it as "cause" breaks that link and feels awkward <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> I don't associate "factor" with refactoring <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/><img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Mijinko_SD/icon' alt='/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor)  
> > re- +‎ factor  
> It might be unclear when written in katakana, but the root is factor, with ing added later <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> I've never seen the word "factor" used in any meaning other than element or cause <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> I've never seen the word "refactor" (in English or Japanese) <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/増井俊之/icon' alt='/villagepump/増井俊之.icon' height="19.5"/>

Example 2
> In the TV drama [[Mito Komon]], it's often heard, "Wouldn't it be better to quickly show the seal before the fight?" <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> No, I don't think many people say that nowadays <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/suto3/icon' alt='/villagepump/suto3.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> It's heard when Mito Komon is brought up. <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/>  
> Is it because the environment around <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mgn901/icon' alt='/villagepump/mgn901.icon' height="19.5"/> is unique?  
> The ambiguity of "often" is causing the disagreement, but if "there are people who say it" exists, isn't it an observed fact? <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon' alt='/villagepump/nishio.icon' height="19.5"/>

Common Pattern
- ![image](https://gyazo.com/a3e3e84d386ed573961bf9155cf1745a/thumb/1000)
- Person A sees X included in their observation range and says "X exists."
- Person B does not see X in their observation range and says "X does not exist."

Consideration
- This is unrelated to the overall size of each person's [[observation range]] (so it's better to avoid using the expression "[[narrow observation range]]").
    - The reverse pattern of "[[learning from people with less knowledge]]"
- If both parties express without omission that "X exists/does not exist in my observation range," [[both claims can be true]].
    - However, [[humans often lack sufficient words]].
