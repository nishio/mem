Feelings When Reading a Book
- A
    - "Yes, exactly that!"
    - "That's what I wanted to say!"
    - "What I was thinking is expressed so well!"
    - The expression in the book connects with something already within me
    - A new expression connects, attaching a [[handle]] to manipulate the concept

- B
    - "I see, so that connects with that!"
    - "I never thought of it that way, interesting"
    - Things that were not connected within me are joined together by the book's expression
    - A new connection is created

- C
    - "Huh? Isn't that wrong?"
    - A sense of discomfort
    - [[Development of Discomfort]]

- D
    - "I see, so that's how it is"
    - It doesn't connect with any of my experiences
    - And then I forget
    - Since it doesn't connect with anything, it's hard to retain in memory
