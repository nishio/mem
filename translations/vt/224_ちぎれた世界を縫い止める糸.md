After the [[Tearing of the World]] leads to the [[Division of Communities]], individuals who move between [[Different Communities]] become the [[Threads That Stitch Them Together]].

- Moving between [[Communities]]
    - [[Boundary Crossers]]
- [[Connecting What Is Torn Apart]]

Development of the Metaphor
- Being too close to the edge of the fabric can cause it to tear again
    - It is not necessary to be in the center of the fabric, but a certain width is required
    - = It is not necessary to become a [[Central Figure in the Community]], but being a complete [[Newcomer]] will not work; a certain level of [[Trust Accumulation]] is needed

    - Resources obtained from a [[Fast Community]] differ from those obtained from a [[Slow Community]], and both are needed
