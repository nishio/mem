> On August 5, the Nikkei Stock Average plummeted, closing at 31,458.42 yen, down 4,451.28 yen (12.4%) from the previous weekend. This drop exceeded the 3,836.48 yen decline on October 20, 1987 (the day after Black Monday when the U.S. stock market crash spread globally), marking the largest drop in history. However, on the following day, the trend reversed, and the Nikkei Average opened at 32,077.33 yen, up 618.91 yen (2.0%) from the previous day, with the increase exceeding 3,000 yen by 9:47 AM.
