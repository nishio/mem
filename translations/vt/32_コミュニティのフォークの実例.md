[[Community]] Fork Example  
![image](https://gyazo.com/7f4e277e2c995e90d40d0c19887077cf/thumb/1000)  
- 1: Mr. Anno, along with Mr. Suzuki, launches [[Digital Democracy 2030]]
- 2: Mr. Anno announces his candidacy & steps down from the Digital Democracy 2030 board
    - This is the fork
    - Some people follow Mr. Anno, while others do not
- 3: A new community called "[[Team Mirai Supporter Slack]]" emerges on Mr. Anno's "Team Mirai" side
    - It grows to about three times the size of Digital Democracy 2030

It's similar to the [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] division
- There is a community that inherits the [[name]] of the community and another that inherits the [[leader]]
