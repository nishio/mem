The Set of Things We Understand, U
- A is included, so it is "understood"
- B is not included, so it is "unknown"
- Delving into B results in C1 and C2, which are also unknown
- Delving into C2 results in D1 and D2, which are understood
- This makes C2 newly understood
- Since C1 remains unknown, B is still not understood
- To understand B, one must delve into all unknowns that emerge from the process until they are understood
    - This incurs a significant cost, but no avoidance method has been found at present

    - Delving deeper to explain according to the needs of the information receiver incurs a significant cost, so it is usually not done for free

Original Experience
- As a childhood experience, I was given an [[encyclopedia]], encountered unknown words, researched them, and repeated this cycle to build what is now called a "[[knowledge network]]"
    - [[Reading Dictionaries]]
    - The advent of online encyclopedias like [[Wikipedia]] made this widely accessible
        - Children raised by parents who think to give them encyclopedias seem to be a reproduction of the [[intelligentsia]]
        - Before Wikipedia, [[libraries]] probably played the role of providing access
- With this as a foundational experience, it tends to lead to the attitude of "If you don't know a word, just look it up"
    - Many people seem to have a rejection reaction just by encountering unknown words, but I can't empathize with that

- Regarding Recording C1
    - As a process of improving one's understanding, it should naturally be preserved
        - C1 is something "not yet delved into" and "may be delved into in the future"
            - It's not good to erase it
    - It is a distraction for readers seeking comprehensible text
        - Concepts not understood by the author are included because "AI generated them"
    - This is the difference between being an [[information producer]] or an [[information consumer]]
        - Like the body of a cow being raised for beef and the restaurant customer wanting it cut into bite-sized pieces and tenderized for eating
