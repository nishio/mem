title: "Recognizing Blind Spots in Learning"
---

- When learning, it is essential to first [[notice]] that "you don't know yet."
    - In learning with textbooks, there are many "unknowns" written in them, so one might perceive "learning" as "something to be learned exists outside oneself, and the act of incorporating it within."
    - In [[learning without textbooks]], one must first discover what they do not know.
    - Nishio expresses this by saying, "To learn, you must first recognize your blind spots."

- Not seeing, yet unaware of not seeing—that is a blind spot.

- Between the domain of "clearly known" and "clearly unknown" lies the domain of "unknown unknowns."
