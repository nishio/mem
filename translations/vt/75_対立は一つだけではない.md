### Opposition Is Not Singular

- Opposition of black and white
- Opposition of smooth and spiky
Both are forms of opposition. The black circle and the white spiky shape both oppose the white circle. However, these two are not the same, nor are they similar.

Here, we have two attributes: black and white, smooth and spiky. If we add the "black spiky" that is not depicted in this diagram, the overall structure becomes like this:

- The white circle and the black spiky shape have nothing in common and appear as [[unrelated]] information.
- Things that feel "opposed" are "closer" compared to those that don't even feel opposed.

So far, we've discussed a world with two types of attributes, each with two values (black and white, smooth and spiky). In reality, events have many more attributes, each capable of taking diverse values.

Let's observe the impact of the number of attributes in a simple case where each attribute has only two possible values. The lines in the diagram connect elements differing by only one attribute value. Humans can intuitively understand up to three attributes, which can be visualized as the edges of a 3D cube.

- Attributes: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Note: There is an error in the diagram with four attributes
- Footnote: Known as a "boolean lattice"

Imagining opposition as a "binary opposition" like good and evil with only one attribute is misleading. In reality, there are countless attributes.

The flower illustration introduced in [[(5.2.4.6) Family Resemblance]] has four attributes:
- If the target's four features are expressed as 1111,
- Group 1
    - 1110, 1010, 1100, 0110
- Group 2
    - 0011, 0001, 0101, 1001
- When depicted in a boolean lattice with four attributes, it looks like this:

![image](https://gyazo.com/a6fec999b1f0d3e96be5fbbcb90c8d5d/thumb/1000)
- Red is Group 1, blue is Group 2
    - It's not ideal to distinguish by color, so it should be corrected in a redrawing

Looking at this diagram, you might feel that Group 1 is closer to the target than Group 2. This perception arises from a different cause than family resemblance. The difference between Group 1 and Group 2 is that Group 1 includes 1110, which is distance 1, while Group 2 includes 0001, which is distance 3.

When we think about opposition, we tend to imagine opposition with a single attribute. We also tend to think that opposing pairs are far apart. However, in the real world, there are many attributes. In such situations, things that are opposed are closer than those that are not even opposed.

So far, we've discussed with two types of attributes (black and white, smooth and spiky). In reality, events have many more attributes, and we can't even grasp how many attributes there are in total.
