Top: If you extend the lower side of a square and measure the distance from the midpoint of the lower side to the vertex, you obtain the golden ratio φ.

Bottom: In an isosceles triangle A with a base of 1 and equal sides of φ, if you place another similar isosceles triangle B inside it, with a base of 1/φ and equal sides of 1, the remaining part C becomes an isosceles triangle with a base of φ and equal sides of 1. From this, it is derived that the internal angles of the triangle are in the ratio of 1:2:3. This triangle is similar to the triangle that appears when a pentagram is superimposed on a regular pentagon.

Middle: When a line segment is divided into φ:1:φ, and the φ+1 part is further divided into φ:1:φ, the left internal division point of the previous division coincides with the right internal division point of the latter division. ((φ+1)/(2φ+1)*(φ+1)=φ) An algorithm utilizing this characteristic is the golden section search.
