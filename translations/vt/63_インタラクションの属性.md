- 1: Attempting to judge the [[value]] by only looking at A
- 2: Attempting to judge the value by observing the [[interaction]] between A and B

- The latter considers "value" as a property attributed not to A or B, but to their interaction

Interaction = [[Mutual Interaction]]  
Attribute of X = [[Property]] attributed to X
