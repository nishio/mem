- When comparing [[Old Things]] and [[New Things]], there are two types of people:
    - A: Those who focus on what the old has that the new lacks ([[Focusing on Deficiencies]])
    - B: Those who focus on what the new has that the old lacks ([[Focusing on Additions]])

People who [[Focus on Deficiencies]] are not [[Future Creators]]
- Because filling in the deficiencies only brings you closer to what [[Already Exists]]
- People who focus on [[Additions]] expand the added parts, giving birth to a new [[Future]]

[[Focusing on Additions]]
