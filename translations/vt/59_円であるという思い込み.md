- We are under the assumption that it is a [[circle]]
    - = We assume it has the [[same value]] regardless of direction
- However, in reality, we only [[observe]] what is easily observable
- In areas that are [[difficult to observe]], it takes different values

Although we write "circle," in most cases it is a higher dimension, thus a [[hypersphere]]

The assumption that the [[edge]] is [[equidistant from the origin]]
