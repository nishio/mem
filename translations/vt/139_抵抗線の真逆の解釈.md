- Some people try to determine future price movements based on whether a [[Resistance Line]] has been breached.
    - Person A argues, "The resistance line has been breached, so the resistance is gone, and the price will rise."
    - Person B argues, "The resistance line, which has been maintained over the long term, has been touched; this is the peak, and the price will fall."
- People tend to mistakenly view the resistance line as an objective entity, but it is a subjective existence that varies in location depending on the person.
    - The interpretation of "breaching the resistance line" is also subjective.
    - Whether one believes it has been breached or not varies from person to person.
        - "Whether the resistance line has been breached" is a [[False Dichotomy]].
